Published Date: 2018/11/19

Organic milk is a small part of the milk market over the world. And debates over the worth of organic products to both producers and consumers have been taking place for long time. It can be classified whole milk, skim milk and semi-skim milk (2%, 1.5%, 1% fat) in the current market. 

The global organic milk average price is in the increase trend overall, from 1.05 USD/L in 2013 to 1.16 USD/L in 2017. The price will be in increase trend as the price index rising up in the future.

The North America market took up about 40% the global market in 2017, followed by Europe (36%), and China took up about 11%. As for China, market insiders think the country will become the most potential consuming region in the coming years.

I went to check and sure enough she has poured the kroger. So on an accidental blind taste test the maple hill blew it away i knew immediately from the taste. 
Was in florida for the holidays and couldn’t get my hands on the maple hill so i was forced to go with the horizon grass fed whole milk which is pretty damn good and only a little bit less great than maple hill.

milk AND price,jqlgdp,You ever think about how terrifyingly large a teraliter of milk would be?,Milk,0,0.75,"Thats straight a cubic kilometer of milk. The average cow produces 6-7 gallons of milk a day, but we need a teraliter, or 1e12 liters. Converted to gallons we get about 264 billion gallons, thats a little over 400,000 olympic swimming pools worth of volume. Michael Phelps top speed clocks in at about 6 miles per hour, for him to swim that length, it would take him about 2,072 hours, a little over 86 days. But back to the topic at hand, milk. A cow can produce on average 6.5 gallons of milk a day, to reach a teraliter of milk we would need about 40.6 billion cows. But here’s the problem, the current approximate global population of cattle is 1.4 billion with about half being female, so 700 million milk producing cows are currently alive on earth, a far cry from the 40 billion needed for a teraliter in a day. For the current population to make a teraliter of milk it would take 58 days to amass all the milk needed. But now we run into another problem, milk doesn’t last for 58 days, so how could we get all this milk and keep it fresh? At the very most, milk can last about 10 days in optimal conditions and still be fresh. Meaning our current global milk output is 1/6 of what we need it to be. That means we need 4.2 billion cows to produce that in 10 days. At the current rate of population growth, cattle populations grow by 32% every 40 years. So in order to have enough cows we would need to wait about 251 years for the cow populations to reach those levels. So lets say that we have the technology and cows to create a teraliter of milk today, how much would it be worth? Current market price of a gallon of milk is around $3.50 USD. And being that we have around 264 billion gallons, that would equate to a market value of around $925 billion USD. With that money, you could pay off the US national debt with 24 teraliters of milk and have some money left over. Being it takes 10 days to produce this, you could pay it off in less than a year. But that posses a rather terrifying question, who actually owns this teraliter of milk? If they have the capabilities to generate over 900 billion dollars in ten days they could basically do whatever they wanted. They could buy whole countries with nothing but milk, and do it again just two weeks later. And if that isn’t power, then i don’t know what the fuck is.",2020-11-08,

dairy AND quality,121ixxx,Do milk delivery business still exist? How did Milk delivery work ?,Milk,2,1.0," **Milk delivery**, once a common practice, which has become a nostalgic memory for many. The sound of the milkman's truck and the clinking of glass bottles delivered straight to the doorstep is a childhood memory for many. But does this practice still exist? In this article, we'll look into the history of milk delivery and explore whether it is still a viable business today. 

Milk delivery was a common sight in cities and towns across the world until the mid-twentieth century. Milkmen would travel around in milk trucks or on horse-drawn carts, delivering fresh milk to households on a daily basis. These milkmen were usually employees of dairy milk farms or companies and were responsible for ensuring that milk was delivered on time and in good condition. 

In those days, cow milk was the most common type of milk delivered to households. It was usually delivered in glass bottles that were sterilized and reused by the dairy farm or company. These bottles were left on the doorstep or front porch of the house, and the milkman would collect the empty bottles during his next visit. 

However, with the rise of supermarkets and refrigeration technology, milk delivery became less popular. Supermarkets made it easier for people to buy dairy products, and refrigeration allowed milk to be stored longer, reducing the need for daily milk delivery. 

Despite the decline of milk delivery, some dairy farms still offer [milk home delivery services](https://goo.gl/maps/JcLow5k7gxD9FzAZ7) in some areas. These dairy farms usually have a loyal customer base who prefer the taste and quality of fresh milk delivered to their doorstep every day. However, the number of milk delivery services has significantly reduced over the years. 

In the digital age, milk delivery has also gone online, with the rise of milk delivery apps that allow customers to order their favorite dairy products from their smartphones and have them delivered to their homes or offices. 

In conclusion, milk delivery may not be the same as it once was, but it is still very much alive and well. For those who value the convenience and quality of fresh, locally-sourced dairy products, milk delivery remains a reliable and popular option.",2023-03-25,

This video can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/340292407).

The day that Mike McCloskey (Fair Oaks Farms Owner) was made aware of the video, he [published a statement](https://fofarms.com/post/response/) on the farm's website in which he expressed his concern and disappointment about the contents of the video, specifically the acts of animal abuse by four of his employees, all of which have been fired.

Before the investigation by ARM was made known to Fair Oaks, three of the Fair Oaks employees were fired after being reported to their supervisor for animal abuse. The fourth was fired soon after.

Dr. McCloskey also posted a video response where he further explains the farm's side of the story, and expresses his sincere apology for the acts of abuse in the video. In his video response, he also explains  the measures the farm had been taking to avoid animal abuse, as well as how the farm will increase its efforts to ensure that these violent acts can be avoided in the future.

As of right now, three of the employees are being investigated on charges of animal cruelty, but have not been taken into custody.

dairy AND common agricultural policy,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.77," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

I am in favor of the program due to the research paid for by the program for corn.  Ethanol became much more affordable due to the research funded with checkoff dollars.  The political lobbying that got ethanol quotas was also funded by Checkoff.

With the success, I'm surprised that other industries haven't tried it.  Unions are similar but not really.  Imagine if all computer sales had to put 1% into the IEEE to fund research for future development.

Or 1% of healthcare costs when to a fund to educate consumers.

I've also read about how New Zealand have completely removed subsidies, tax concessions and price supports and yet have a very healthy and strong agricultural sector, making up the largest sector of the tradable economy, contributing about two-thirds of New Zealand's exports.

I've also read about how subsidies keep poor countries from developing their agricultural sector, and how we can help them improve and even remove hunger by making them able to produce and sell their food on the market. In other words, if we buy their food instead of keeping them out and only buy food made by our own farmers, we can help them grow in knowledge and self sufficiency.

Now I've talked to a lot of farmers, and some of them are for this, while most of them are for the current situation, where at least for my country, the subsidies make up for about 50-60% of income and theres heavy tolls and import barriers on food from other countries.

dairy AND subsidies,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.73," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

dairy AND yield,43upcb,Increasing milk solids in dairy production?,farming,11,1.0,"Hello /r/farming -

My wife and I run a 125-ish head goat dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada, and turn all of the milk into a variety of cheeses.  Due to ever increasing grain prices in recent years (up ~ 40% over the last 5 years), we've been pondering taking the dairy purely grass based (there are other reasons for this, but cost is a big one for us).  The area we're in is fairly good for forage production, and depending on the year, we can frequently pasture between late March/early April and mid-to-late October.  Granted, the early fall grasses aren't as good as that spring flush, but animals definitely prefer it to hay, and we like the characteristics grazing and browsing gives to the milk, and in turn to our cheeses.

Were we to drastically cut back on grain, what should I be looking at doing to help keep the milk solids (ie. fat and protein) as high as possible, which would give us the best cheese yields?  ",2016-02-02,
dairy AND yield,1576595,How many different hybrids/seed types do you tend to use?,farming,15,1.0,"Hi all,

I’m just curious how many different types of seed do you typically run in a given year for each crop? Obviously different strains will do better in different soil types but do you stick with just 1 or 2 you’ve had good luck with? Do you try a bunch of different seeds at once in a test plot? Or do you run a multitude in different fields to try to cover yourself in case a couple don’t produce well? 

My area is mostly made up of smaller dairy farms and orchards. The only field crop that gets grown in any real quantity is corn. It seems that most of the locals stick with either 1 or 2 varieties though I’ll occasionally see a plot where someone appears to be testing different strains/spacing out.

If you do run a variety of types in a given year how complicated does it make your life? Do you find yourself having to treat each field differently during the growing season/at harvest or does everything kind of just flow as normal and you just tally up yields at the end of the year?",2023-07-23,

dairy AND yield,ryo500,I was wondering if any of you have positive (or negative) experiences with some artisanal-scale projects to create foodstuffs from your own farming yields.,farming,16,0.67,"**Question**: What are some nice products or byproducts like (honey, olive oil, cheese, ...) that can be created as a sort of value-adding hobby (passion project) to farm yields that can be farmed on a 7-11ha plot of land? Preferably limiting the investment in very specific more expensive equipment. 

**Context**: My family is looking into buying a smallish (7-11ha) plot of land in the lower half of Portugal. (my mother really wants to move there to slow down and ease into retirement.) She would like to rent out a vacation home. My dad wants a farm-related hobby-ish project.

My mother has this idea rather developed and stable on her end. My father however ... errr, is ambitous? In his typical manner, he is all over the place. 

The goal is to create a permaculture ""farm"", or at least try. Thus some animals will be kept on a couple of ha. Most likely there will be a sizeable olive plantation too. It's not likely feasible or desirable to try any wholesale/industrial farming efforts. Yet we'll have to do some things with a decent portion of the land for maintenance either way.

My father, the enthusiastic culinary soul, hopes to do something like a community project. We don't have the kind of capital for larger projects, that just cost money.

So to avoid traps and/or disappointment I was wondering if any of you have positive (or negative) experiences with some artisanal-scale projects to create foodstuffs from your own farming yields.

dairy AND yield,gqhrl1,How to bridge the gap between environmentalists and farmers?,farming,36,0.95,"Okay, I know this is a sensitive topic, but it's one I'm super interested in. Sorry if this is too long. 

I grew up in a rural community in Northwestern PA on a small farm- horses and blueberries for the local area. I was surrounded by small farms of all sorts- beef, dairy, wool, hay, and grains of all sorts. I then went to school for environmental science and moved to a larger city- Pittsburgh.

Over my years, I've definitely noticed a disconnect between environmental concern and how farming is actually done. Stuff like seed patents and GMOs are non-issue for farmers, but environmentalists still are concerned about them. 

I've taken an eco-pragmatist/Bright Green approach to environmentalism. I'm all for better tech like GMOs, better and safer pesticides that are more targeted, higher yields, better application technology for fertilizers. This is the kind of stuff I see some of my fellow environmentalists either not liking or understanding, as some would rather see the return to small farms for everyone- but I believe that would be a disaster for land use, which is a main concern of mine due to biodiversity loss. 

What do you think it would take to bridge the gap between environmentalists and farmers? I rather make bonds between the two groups so that effective policy and regulations can be create and the two sides understand each other better. 

Also, another question- I know area of contention is meat production. I've been seeing a lot about meat production due antibiotic resistance/SARS-COV-2, greenhouse gasses, land use, and water pollution. I'm no vegetarian, and I think the ""you can't be an environmentalist and eat meat"" message is gatekeeping and harmful for the environmental as a whole. 

I will say these are concerning to me though from my understanding water pollution is a rather small problem from large, well-regulated farms, and a lot of this from fertilizer run off instead. I'm really most concerned about greenhouse gasses and land use, with anti-biotic resistance staying on my radar. Are these things to be concerned about? And what role do you think meat replacements- veg-meat and lab-grown meat- will play in the future due to these concerns?",2020-05-25,

dairy AND yield,1ez7uw,Financing a new farm from scratch?,farming,23,0.9,"Hi! My wife and I, mid-thirties with impeccable credit, are interested in starting a new farm from scratch. We aren't interested in picking a commodity crop that does well in our area (Western Montana) and growing as much of it as we can, we'd prefer to dabble in a diversity of products - small goat dairy with value-adds, rabbitry, eggs, maybe some aquaculture, taking the time to grow a modest 500 or so tree orchard, berries, herbs, annual veggies, etc etc etc. A one-stop shop.

The thing with this, is that it takes *time* to build all this. Some of these products wont yield a materially harvestable amount for several years, such as the orchard.

In the event that we were able to secure financing for 100+ acres plus some equipment, how does financing work when you wont be grossing much in the way of revenue for a while? 

Is starting a new farm even a thing any more? Or do you kinda have to get in on an operation that is already established in the marketplace? 

tldr: Is there a way to finance a new farm that allows the farm to mature? 

edit: Really interesting dialogue going here. Thanks so much for all the replies. Upvotes all around. More about us, we currently own a house on 2 acres and have a handful of milk goats, rabbits, chickens. Yes our credit is 800+ each. I've got 15 years cross-industry business and financial management experience. She's got 7 + years of self-employment and has owned livestock of one kind or another all her life. We've explored Grade A dairy certification for where we're at, but don't see us growing beyond 8 milk goats here and infrastructure costs are too high to justify for that few. I love love love the idea of starting small and growing into it but if at least one of us is tied to a full-time in-city jobbie-job, we aren't going to be able to get enough land with our everyday cashflow (I'm talking even just 10 acres) where a commute is realistic. So how does one start small? If we could make a real run of it with the 2 acres we have, that'd be great, but I don't think that will cut it. Would love to hear that I am wrong though. ",2013-05-24,
dairy AND yield,1af668,Question for the grain farmers out there...,farming,11,1.0,"My wife and I run a small dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada.  Our grain prices have been rising steadily over the last several years - they're about 15-20% higher now compared to two years ago.

We're farming on 100 acres, of which only about 15 or so are used for grazing our livestock.  We have a good supply of manure, both chicken and ruminant, and I've been pondering the viability of putting 10 or so acres into barley or wheat.

* What sort of yield can one generally expect in my climate?  Our flat bottom fields are all rich peat.
* Related to the last question, if I'm shooting for about 20 or so tonnes per year, how many acres would I need in production?
* What sort of equipment (preferably small and inexpensive) would be best for farming at this scale?
* Are there good varieties that'd do well in our wetter climate out here?  (We're in BC, but the climate would be similar to Washington state or Oregon.)
* Do you think this a bad idea?  I'm entirely open to this being a bad idea. :)
* In my online research, I've come across an timey turnip/wheat/barley/clover rotation.  I'm aware it's more work, but the ability to close the loop on the bulk of our farm inputs is appealing.  Does anyone have any experience or advice on this sort of rotation?

dairy AND yield,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.77," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

My wife and I run a 125-ish head goat dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada, and turn all of the milk into a variety of cheeses.  Due to ever increasing grain prices in recent years (up ~ 40% over the last 5 years), we've been pondering taking the dairy purely grass based (there are other reasons for this, but cost is a big one for us).  The area we're in is fairly good for forage production, and depending on the year, we can frequently pasture between late March/early April and mid-to-late October.  Granted, the early fall grasses aren't as good as that spring flush, but animals definitely prefer it to hay, and we like the characteristics grazing and browsing gives to the milk, and in turn to our cheeses.

Were we to drastically cut back on grain, what should I be looking at doing to help keep the milk solids (ie. fat and protein) as high as possible, which would give us the best cheese yields?  ",2016-02-02,

First of all I'd like to say I'm not a farmer, far from it, I'm a software developer. Never the less I have huge respect for what all of you do. I, probably like a lot of people am becoming increasingly frustrated with the quality and price of supermarkets. Now I know they are not going to go away, but what I was wondering is if there could be an realistic 'direct from farm' alternative. I've noticed and embraced the local farms near to where I live have started to offer parts of this, for example a local dairy farm now has a milk vending machine where you can buy fresh pasteurised whole milk. Another was offering BBQ boxes in the summer with a selection of cuts great for the grill. Which is amazing, I've loved having that available to me. But it doesn't quite do enough to mean I don't have to trawl round Tesco once a week, trying to figure out why my tomatoes have more airmiles than I do this year.  
If there was something like Amazon for local fresh produce direct from the farm then I would be a very loyal customer, and I'm absolutely certain others would too. As much as it's great to go to the farm to buy a BBQ box once a month, it just doesnt quite have the convenience that means it fits into day to day life. Although I have a one year old so day to day life for me is trying to get to bedtime without having to go to A&amp;E, so I'm probably a bad example.  
I guess my question to your community, is how feasible is it for you to go direct to consumers, what would prevent you from listing your produce on an online marketplace and would you even want to in the first place?  
I really am of the opinion it would be something the public would want, but I absolutely understand with every other pressure you guys are under at the moment that it would have to seamlessly integrate with your business.

Some big ones i've seen in the region i work in:

1. more erratic weather patterns: on the crop production side, more rain overall and extreme precipitation earlier and more drought conditions later.
2. the intensification of the issues of low dairy prices: milk processors failing and merging, the supply not really changing because smaller herds are absorbed by bigger producers, less milk in schools, ect.
3. Trade/geopolitical uncertainty on regional soybean exports: prices were already dropping from post great-recession levels. A good portion barely broke even last year.

So we are just getting started on farming/homesteading. We have just over thirty acres, one Jersey heifer, some laying chickens and some meat birds ~150 birds all together, we have three feeder pigs arriving this week. 

The discussion is regarding cows/cattle. Millie, our little heifer is lonely and we want to get her some companions. I found an elderly Jersey cow (13) with two calves on her for $2500. One of the calves is A2/A2 and the other is an adopted red Angus/jerseyx. I think they would be a great addition and I think it's a reasonable price. I figure we can breed our heifer Millie this season, breed the older cow this season, breed the A2/A2 calf and Millie next year and slaughter the angusx next year. Any calves we produce we can either sell or eat depending on sex. Having multiple milk cows is insurance that we will always be in milk. I also think getting an older, proven cow will be a better teaching tool for me as Millie is totally untrained and pretty skiddish. I'm hoping a more mature cow around will put her (and me) at ease. I see purchasing these as an investment that will give us returns. They have however been up for sale for a long time so maybe there is something I'm missing. Maybe introducing a cow with calves to a lone heifer is not the best way to install a herd...

My husband is leaning more towards purchasing steers. He thinks we can get a yearling to slaughter in the fall and a weaner to carry through winter to keep Millie company until she calves. We are in an area with a lot of Angus cattle, I think trying to sell the meat will be a lot harder and that'll be too much meat for our family. But maybe I'm looking at it all wrong. Maybe doubling down on cows is unwise. Maybe there's a reason there's so many cattle farmers around here and selling an A2A2 Jersey will be hard.

I've also read about how New Zealand have completely removed subsidies, tax concessions and price supports and yet have a very healthy and strong agricultural sector, making up the largest sector of the tradable economy, contributing about two-thirds of New Zealand's exports.

I've also read about how subsidies keep poor countries from developing their agricultural sector, and how we can help them improve and even remove hunger by making them able to produce and sell their food on the market. In other words, if we buy their food instead of keeping them out and only buy food made by our own farmers, we can help them grow in knowledge and self sufficiency.

Now I've talked to a lot of farmers, and some of them are for this, while most of them are for the current situation, where at least for my country, the subsidies make up for about 50-60% of income and theres heavy tolls and import barriers on food from other countries. The government currently makes a lot of the decisions on food production.

milk AND price,phej2,"Crop farmers that have transitioned into vegetable farming, how did you do it?",farming,4,0.92,"A quick background.  Our farm started as a dairy farm.  I had no desire to milk cows every day for the rest of my life, so after college I worked in TV for a couple of years.  My TV station when bankrupt about the same time my parents sold the dairy herd.  

So I came back to the farm on a temporary basis and am still there 11 years later.  We crop farm, make hay and straw (lots of landscapers and contractors) and run a corn maze and pumpkin patch in the fall.  We're fairly close to Washington DC in a town that is becoming a foodie destination so vegetables (for restaurants or roadside stand) seems like a good option.  

The problem is, when vegetables need the most attention, is when I'm super busy with hay and straw.  By the time I'm caught up on those jobs my test plots have become a jungle of redroot, lambs quarter and Johnson Grass.

milk AND price,1af668,Question for the grain farmers out there...,farming,11,1.0,"My wife and I run a small dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada.  Our grain prices have been rising steadily over the last several years - they're about 15-20% higher now compared to two years ago.

We're farming on 100 acres, of which only about 15 or so are used for grazing our livestock.  We have a good supply of manure, both chicken and ruminant, and I've been pondering the viability of putting 10 or so acres into barley or wheat.

* What sort of yield can one generally expect in my climate?  Our flat bottom fields are all rich peat.
* Related to the last question, if I'm shooting for about 20 or so tonnes per year, how many acres would I need in production?
* What sort of equipment (preferably small and inexpensive) would be best for farming at this scale?
* Are there good varieties that'd do well in our wetter climate out here?  (We're in BC, but the climate would be similar to Washington state or Oregon.)
* Do you think this a bad idea?  I'm entirely open to this being a bad idea. :)
* In my online research, I've come across an timey turnip/wheat/barley/clover rotation.  I'm aware it's more work, but the ability to close the loop on the bulk of our farm inputs is appealing.  Does anyone have any experience or advice on this sort of rotation?

milk AND price,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.73," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

Maybe we could see an agricultural-technology renaissance coupled with a healthy eating mindset.",2023-03-10,
dairy AND quality,17hmjz6,An idea,farming,20,0.61,"Hi guys,

First of all I'd like to say I'm not a farmer, far from it, I'm a software developer. Never the less I have huge respect for what all of you do. I, probably like a lot of people am becoming increasingly frustrated with the quality and price of supermarkets. Now I know they are not going to go away, but what I was wondering is if there could be an realistic 'direct from farm' alternative. I've noticed and embraced the local farms near to where I live have started to offer parts of this, for example a local dairy farm now has a milk vending machine where you can buy fresh pasteurised whole milk. Another was offering BBQ boxes in the summer with a selection of cuts great for the grill. Which is amazing, I've loved having that available to me. But it doesn't quite do enough to mean I don't have to trawl round Tesco once a week, trying to figure out why my tomatoes have more airmiles than I do this year.  
If there was something like Amazon for local fresh produce direct from the farm then I would be a very loyal customer, and I'm absolutely certain others would too. As much as it's great to go to the farm to buy a BBQ box once a month, it just doesnt quite have the convenience that means it fits into day to day life. Although I have a one year old so day to day life for me is trying to get to bedtime without having to go to A&amp;E, so I'm probably a bad example.  
I guess my question to your community, is how feasible is it for you to go direct to consumers, what would prevent you from listing your produce on an online marketplace and would you even want to in the first place?  
I really am of the opinion it would be something the public would want, but I absolutely understand with every other pressure you guys are under at the moment that it would have to seamlessly integrate with your business. 

Anyway, let me know if you have any thoughts.",2023-10-27,

We got completely out of debt and made a chunk of money on our house sale. 

After a year of research we looked at over 35 farms. We did the most granular research and ended up finding two great options we love. We about to move on one. We studied, soil, markets, land use, regs etc...

Obviously I wish I could gain more experience and knowledge but I don't have that luxury. I did the most I can in three years. I feel confident in the specific farming I want to do. I have a three year old and I want her settled before kindergarten. 

When I was younger I worked in a bunch of restaurants and I have great relationships with the owners. They have all been open to buying from me when I'm ready.

dairy AND quality,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.73," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

We intend to divide the fields into pastures for beef cattle/sheep and dairy cattle/goats.

We’re having a hell of a time getting advice on what a workable pasture mix for the Great Lakes region would look like, so we’ve had to put together ideas from the internet.

This is what we’ve settled on -

For beef/sheep at 20lb/acre:
- 25% Meadow Brome
- 15% Orchard Grass
- 15% End free Tall Fescue
- 20% Rye Grass
- 10% White Clover
- 5% Alfalfa
- 5% Chicory
- 5% Birdsfoot Trefoil

For dairy/goat at 20lb/
- 30% Rye
- 20% Meadow Brome
- 20% Orchard Grass
- 10% Alfalfa
- 10% White &amp; Red Clover
- 4% Chicory
- 3% Birdsfoot Trefoil
- 3% Forage Peas

Autumn/Winter Forage at 120lb/
- 60% Winter-kill Oats
- 30% Turnips or related
- 10% Rapeseed

Basically, would these work? Is there anything we missed? I don’t mind making mistakes, but I want to get this one right for obvious reasons.",2022-01-14,

My wife and I run a 125-ish head goat dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada, and turn all of the milk into a variety of cheeses.  Due to ever increasing grain prices in recent years (up ~ 40% over the last 5 years), we've been pondering taking the dairy purely grass based (there are other reasons for this, but cost is a big one for us).  The area we're in is fairly good for forage production, and depending on the year, we can frequently pasture between late March/early April and mid-to-late October.  Granted, the early fall grasses aren't as good as that spring flush, but animals definitely prefer it to hay, and we like the characteristics grazing and browsing gives to the milk, and in turn to our cheeses.

Were we to drastically cut back on grain, what should I be looking at doing to help keep the milk solids (ie. fat and protein) as high as possible, which would give us the best cheese yields?  ",2016-02-02,

dairy AND grass,28wzgf,Planning for Farming - resource list and advice please!,farming,7,0.67,"My husband and I are planning on purchasing a farm property in North-Central Alabama within the next 3 years or so, with the intention of homesteading/farming the land.  Our immediate goals would be to supply most of our personal food needs, with the eventual intention of making a modest amount of money from it.  The ideas we are most seriously considering are meat animals raised for the grass fed/pastured crowd as well as high end grocers or restaurants, possibly heritage poultry, as well as dairy goats/cows for value-added products.  This is not including the veggies, chickens, eggs, etc for personal use to feed ourselves and our friends/family.  Everything we know now says that the most financially viable route is to find niche markets and fill the gourmet needs.  The few farmer friends I have spoken to say that doing the farmer's market route is tough and may not be worth the effort.  The farmer's market scene in AL is pretty thin, although I guess the only place to go is up. 

First, what would your suggestions be regarding the amount of land required to make this idea reality?  I'm thinking at least 100 acres, and I do know that finding good water sources is important.  The land around the area tends to be mixed pasture and forest, from what google earth has shown me.  

Because we are several years out from our goal and we know there is a steep learning curve, we are looking for good resources and books to read to educate ourselves.  I don't want to be the urban hipsters who move in next door and don't know how to fence our goats properly, lol.  I've already come across the names of Joel Salatin and Fukuoka, but we are looking for more sustainable/organic leaning resources.  

My personal skills are pretty good as far as the ""farm wife"" end goes.  For example, I have a pretty good handle on canning and preserving, fermenting, rendering lard and tallow, gardening, yogurt and cheesemaking, laying chickens in the small scale.  No experience with livestock or managing land besides my uncle offering to buy me a baby goat for a pet once.  My husband is even worse, since he has always lived an urban/suburban lifestyle.  However, he hates his office job and really wants to do this.

dairy AND grass,69k4wm,Just bought a farmhouse on some acreage and have a ton of questions. LONG READ,farming,6,0.99,"So, before you say ""Oh lord, another city boy buying a farm"". I spent many years as a winemakers apprentice. And for those in the know all a winemaker is, is a glorified grape farmer. I know my way around a tractor, making things grow, and working grueling long days on a farm.

But the lady and I had our offer accepted on a large house on 10.5 acres. There is a large barn on the property, that is two stories, as in the not too distant past, it was a dairy farm. The old owners are going to be taking out the cow stalls and clearing out the barn before we move in.  The lady wants horses and part of the barn will be a stable.

I dont have a lot of experience in the cost of things, as I used my old boss' equipment, and there was a lot I did that was probably different than other farms, or might be specific to that vineyard I worked on. I apologize for the long post, I am just the type of person who likes as much detail as possible.

So, the property is in South/Central NY, near the PA border. So I know my first priority is a tractor. Based on my research it seems as though I may need 35-45 HP for my type of property. I will mostly be using it to mow, and plow, and till, as well as everything else that comes with a farm with horses.

I will have a plot of land set aside for growing crops. Nothing big, just enough for my family and I, and canning surplus. And Ill need it to haul around loads of stuff like manure, and feed, etc.

SO...what are some affordable, but dependable makers for tractors that I may need? Price range for tractors in my range, used? new? I plan to do the maintenance and wrenching myself.

affordable but dependable 3 hitch attachments for the things I may need?

There are so many brand names, and I dont know what reasonable prices are.

On the farm side, I guess, what do you do with all that, well...shit? I dont want to just spread it all the time across the property, and just smell horse shit all day.

I was thinking maybe pouring a cement slab, and creating a composting pile for all the poop. Is this reasonable? Or should I bury it? How far away should anything poop related be, from the house to avoid smell?

Mowing...When I was on the vineyard, when I mowed, my boss had me just let it lie, where it was cut. Is this what is supposed to be done, on large property? How about near the house itself? Do I get a rake attachment for the tractor? what do you do with all that grass?

Hay...have no experience with it. Any info is appreciated.

Not trying to be lazy...I know theres tons of info out there, but Im jsut trying to get the human side, with someone that may understand my newness to the situation as that was them at some point.

One of the big things I've been looking at diversifying into has been hogs. I've always been curious about the sustainability of free-ranging hogs in a similar way that you open-range cattle.

My big questions have always been:
1) Marketability: I've seen how cows go from one farmer to another in different stages until delivery to the feed lot, but I'm clueless on how hog farming works. It always seems to me they raise them from piglets to 300 pounds in the same massive hog barn and then take them to slaughter. So if I grew my own hogs, can you direct sell them to a feed-lot/slaughter house in the same way you do cattle, or is it a differnet system?

2) Fencing, I've heard electric fence works miracles, pigs are smart, and they don't mess with a single line of tape after they get shocked once. Others have told me you need to have the entire property fenced in with that pig fence that goes underground to keep them from rooting under it. What works?

3) Can pasture be sustainable for a hog? Cows can grow purely on pasture grass, but hogs mainly seem to feed on tubers, mushrooms, other underground stuff. How much land is required to feed a hog?

dairy AND farmers,18719st,"Contracted with a local (large) dairy to grow silage, they would cut and pay for it. Now farmers are being ghosted and unpaid",farming,31,0.95,"Contract stated within 2 weeks of cutting that checks for payment would be sent to the silage growers. That deadline was almost 3 months ago. About 2 months ago, calling their office led to either being booted straight to voicemail, or it would just keep ringing and no one would pick up. Tried again recently and now the phone number has been disconnected. 

Obviously not being paid for the crop someone spent hundreds of hours and a lot of money to raise, with bills and loans to be paid has left many myself and other nearby farmers in a lurch. 

How exactly does one handle this? So many questions:

1) Do I just retain a lawyer and sue for non-payment 

2) What if the fuckers are bankrupt? For some reason the dairies around my area are always late on payments, and this year *especially so*. Rumor has it that they ""overextended"" themselves, though I'm not sure exactly what the means. 

3) Did they buy more silage than they can afford to/are able to use, and so they've decided to just cut everyone's silage and pay only certain people and weasel out from paying for the rest?

4) What would/have you guys done in similar situations? Are there any laws (Colorado) or statutes of limitations in relation to the time we have in bringing them to court before they can just pretend nothing happened and not pay? Just asking because I wouldn't be surprised

dairy AND farmers,1bkt760,For those farmers out there struggling.,farming,21,1.0,"We are well into our calving (only 192 cows autumn calving at the moment)
Already we have had 100 odd cows in the last 2 weeks push out their calves. It has been a hectic couple of weeks some nights only had 3hrs sleep and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
1 being quicker calving get it over and done with another being already over half way 2 weeks in is a good run.

My point is that too all those farmers out there struggling through their days I hear you and honestly farming is the best and worst job at the same time but I wouldn't have it any other way. Us farmers have one of the hardest jobs at times and I think it's time we pat each other and ourselves on the back and say that we are proud of ourselves for the service we bring to the populace. 

I'm not just talking dairy farming I'm talking dry stock sheep veges etc any food that is grown to feed the population of this world. 

It's a bitter sweet feeling as I calve another breach cow and stay up till 2am to wait for the vet to turn up and cut a calf out that had 4 legs and a head in all the wrong places to then get up at 5am and do it all good over again . Nature doesn't rest.

In other words, the calves drank pretty much the whole lactation's milk production. Seems crazy uneconomical, but then I got to thinking, isn't that what beef producers do? 

I mean a cow-calf operation keeps cows year-round that do nothing but give birth to and raise a single calf. And despite the margins for beef production being lower than in dairy production (At least in Canada), beef farmers seem to be able to make some money under that system. In theory, is there any reason why a dairy farmer couldn't keep a few extra cows on a cheaper ration just for the purpose of raising replacements? Would it be less economical than a beef farmer doing the same thing? Obviously it wouldn't pay to keep every heifer calf with this system, but if you had a low replacement rate (&lt;25%?), it seems like it could work.",2022-01-11,

To explain my situation a bit, in case it matters, I've eaten meat and dairy my whole life and I love it, flavor whise and texture whise, but I also love animals. My partner is vegan and has a very strong stance on animal cruelty, and she's set in believing that all cow farming are inherently cruel and inhumane. We end up discussing this pretty often and I always mention I need to know more before I can really take a stance on the subject, but it's so hard to find truly unbiased sources of information. She's tried showing me some things but it often feels biased towards the vegan point of view and she can see that too.

So, I'm looking for better sources of information. I've decided to spend some time today reading up on it and so far, the best I've found is [this article](https://www.fwi.co.uk/business/13-milk-myths-misconceptions-debunked) from ""Farmers Weekly"" but I'm still not sure what I'm reading is really unbiased. Everything seems either entirely negative or almost entirely positive, and a vast majority of what I'm getting from my google searches are from PETA, which I consider heavily biased.

Ever since I was in middle school, God spoke to me and told me to farm. I felt a strong connection with the land and the animals, especially the Holstein cows. They are so beautiful and gentle, and they produce the best milk. I love everything about dairy farming, even the manure and the John Deere tractors. I think God’s plan is for me to stay here, get stronger at Leg Up Farms, work on a dairy farm, move out and start my own farm!
I know what you’re thinking. How can I be a dairy farmer when I have Fredrich’s Ataxia and use a wheelchair? Well, let me tell you, it’s not impossible. There are many examples of successful farmers with disabilities who have adapted their farms and equipment to suit their needs. For instance, there is a farmer in Wisconsin who uses a wheelchair and milks his cows with a robotic system. There is also a farmer in Iowa who has a custom-made tractor with a lift and hand controls. There are even organizations that help farmers with disabilities, such as AgrAbility, which provides resources, training, and assistance.
I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, but it’s not impossible either. I have a lot of challenges to overcome, but I also have a lot of strengths and skills. I have a good knowledge of dairy farming, thanks to the books and videos I’ve read and watched. I have a good work ethic and a positive attitude. I have a lot of support from my family, friends, and mentors. And most importantly, I have God on my side, who gives me strength and guidance every day.
So please, don’t doubt me, make fun of me, mock me, or look at me strange. Instead, support me, encourage me, pray for me, and celebrate with me. This is my dream, and I’m going to make it happen. I’m 22 years old now, and I give myself 10 years or more to achieve it, but time will only tell. I hope you’ll join me on this journey and see me become a dairy farmer. Thank you for reading and God bless you all! 🐄",2023-11-30,

It's inside of Route 128, the inner beltway of the metropolitan area, so it's pleasantly surprising that we have any local milk producers that I can support. It's definitely not a boutique or fancy brand, it's just a brand of milk that a lot of stores carry around here. I won't name them because it would feel awful to give them any bad publicity.

However, rarely when I get this milk, I notice there is a slight peanut taste which isn't very pleasant. It's still drinkable, and I don't notice it when mixed into tea, but if I just drink a glass of the milk I swear there is a slight peanut note. Is this a flavor defect that can be caused by feeding the cows a lot of peanut products, perhaps? I thought it was just a fluke the first time it happened a few months ago, but we got another gallon this week that also has it. It's only something I have ever noticed with milk from this company. 

We're a 1% milk household if the fat percentage comes into play when talking about possible milk flavor defects, if that's something that changes things.

* From what I have gathered so far, there appears to be an idea of introducing a quota system similar to Canada. Will that make a direct impact on the industry in terms of selling price? If so, would that allow for a comfortable living wage?
* Who or what is responsible for the sharp decline in profits? Is it a single group or multiple, government,  dairy farmers, etc.?
* Can President Trump's NAFTA plan assist in the recovery or is the intended audience too niche to make a real impact?
* Will there ever be hope for a full recovery of the industry in the future or do things still appear bleak?

milk AND price,15oanwh,Milk price payment for farmers,dairyfarming,7,0.8,"I want first hand opinion from you guys regarding the price you get for the milk being produced on farm.
As far as it's my understanding,  a farmer gets into a contract with a processor/co-operative,  to whom they sell their milk. And for each kg of milk, the farmer is given a specific price.
Now, I have the following question.
1. For how long these contracts are for (1 year, 2 year etc) ?

I ask this because I am working on a model, to see how much milk price is given to dairy farmers in different regions in a year.

Now in some parts of the year (spring mostly) the milk price is lower as compared to  price in autumn/winter.
Now I understand, the dairy farmers are calving their cows just before spring so that their cows are giving the highest amount of milk in the time when there is abundant availability of feed. 

But what if you were to shift this calving by 4-5  month only, understandably you will have to ensure the abundance of feed in the seasons when the feed availability is less but you will be getting highest milk prices, while the herd will be producing the highest amount of milk. 

Any insights,  comments or feedback will be highly appreciated.

[GIPHY.com](https://i.redd.it/7dyh3s8l1i071.gif)

*Let’s just say milk pricing is about as simple as a graduate-level statistics course…*

So it was no surprise last month when the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) [asked](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cubm1wZi5vcmclMkZkYWlyeS1mYXJtZXJzLXRvLXNlZWstZW1lcmdlbmN5LXVzZGEtaGVhcmluZy1vbi1jbGFzcy1pLW1vdmVyLXJlZm9ybSUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3052) the USDA for an emergency hearing regarding milk pricing structure. But - *real talk* \- not all dairy farmers have a “glass half full” view of the proposal.

**Refresher:** Milk sales are regulated by Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) that set milk prices based on the class (intended use) of the milk.

Class I milk prices (the jug in your fridge) are [calculated](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cueWFua2VlZmFybWNyZWRpdC5jb20lMkZibG9nJTJGanVseS0yMDIwJTJGYS1uZWdhdGl2ZS1wcGQtZXhwbGFpbmVkJTNGY2F0ZWdvcnlpZCUzRDE3&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3053) based on the average of cheese (Class III) and powder milk (Class IV), with an added premium.

**Enter the ‘rona:** COVID-19 messed with the milk market big time in 2020. As cheese prices influenced fluid prices, dairy farmers took the ultimate hit. The NMPF’s proposal seeks to change price structuring...and make up for some 2020 losses.

But some producers are saying, “*hold your* *~~horses~~* *holsteins*.”

In a letter sent to Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack, five Midwestern [dairy groups](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cud2lzZmFybWVyLmNvbSUyRnN0b3J5JTJGbmV3cyUyRjIwMjElMkYwNSUyRjE0JTJGZGFpcnktZ3JvdXBzLXN0cmVzcy1ob2xpc3RpYy1hcHByb2FjaC10by1taWxrLXByaWNpbmctcmVmb3JtJTJGNTA5MTU3NDAwMSUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3054) put forth their own proposal dubbed *Class III Plus*.

The Class III Plus crew says that their [proposal](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYWdkYWlseS5jb20lMkZsaXZlc3RvY2slMkZkYWlyeS1ncm91cHMtY2xhc3MtaWlpLXBsdXMtYmV0dGVyLW1pbGstcHJpY2luZyUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3055) provides future stability, allows for better risk management, and does not increase long-term consumer prices.

**Soundbite:** ""*\[The NMPF proposal\] attempts to claw back lost revenue in the short term and leaves larger problems unsolved. Our organizations prefer sensible changes that will last for decades,*"" noted Amy Penterman, president of the Dairy Business Association.

**Bottom line:** The groups aren’t pushing for an emergency FMMO hearing. But if it happens, they say the discussion needs to be broader in scope and “tackle more than just Class I pricing.”

dairy AND quality,pr4x43,A strange question about British milk,dairyfarming,8,0.5,"Yesterday I picked up a little pamphlet aimed at proselytizing to kids considered Jewish by Orthodox Judaism despite their lack of familiarity with Jewish practices (it was at a sketchy part of Tel-Aviv). It mentioned a rather strange story by a ‘famous rav living in Britain’, explaining that Jewish witnesses need to witness the milking process when buying milk from idolators (this includes Christians), because back in the Middle Ages they could mix the kosher milk with some milk from non-kosher animals. At the end of the story the rav mentions a non-Jewish farmer who explains that British authorities deem milk up to standards by its fat content, concluding it’s been mixed with water and therefor unsellable if it’s too low, which is why je sometimes puts some porcine milk in the bovine to make sure it gets the all clear. (The point of the story is to show the wide reach of rabbinical thought, which proves itself surprisingly relevant even in present-day situations.)

Is there any truth to such claims? It sounds very strange to me, considering skim milk is a thing.

(For those of you who speak Hebrew and whose interest I piqued, the pamphlet in question has a picture of a young boy sitting on an elephant’s trunk with the title ‘תינוק שנשבה’ and the name יעקב קמחי on the cover, but the summary in the back contradicts the contents, so it might have been a misprint.

dairy AND farmers,1csx3rq,Questions for Dairy Farmers about Avian Influenza,dairyfarming,3,0.99,"Greetings all. A few hopefully respectful questions from a non-farmer, and a mostly plant-based eater.

I have been on a bit of a personal journey to understand more about our food system. Most modern humans outside of farmers and ranchers are entirely separated from the production of both the plants and animals they consume, and this disconnect IMHO is a primary source of societal behavioral distortions and negative impacts that we are seeing all around us -- to human health, to the environment, to animals, &amp; even to our own spirits/morality. 

Anyway, long intro, but as a part of this journey I have been following the news on avian influenza.  I live in a county in Northern California with deep ag roots, and where we had a major outbreak of avian flu last year.  

Then, there came the recent news that avian influenza viral particles have been found in 20% of the milk supply out there on the shelves. I find this pretty alarming... 

Even if pasteurization prevents the virus from being viable and makes non-raw milk products ""safe"" to consume, this striking announcement does mean that avian flu is now spreading - potentially extensively - in the US dairy cow population, not just in poultry farms.  Killing the virus in the final product meant for human consumption does nothing to negate the issue that the virus is spreading out there at dairies, and very likely increasing.

Given that the mortality rate of avian flu for humans among known cases in past outbreaks was around 50% (that comes from a [WHO publication](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20240503.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_130)) it feels like we are playing with fire here.

It's like we haven't learned any of the lessons from the past pandemic -- about better monitoring, reporting, and communicating to the people. Given the average person's lack of agency around their food sourcing, we are expected to trust our regulators, as well as those who are producing our food. But it is not clear the political and personal economic interests operating in the market align with broader public health. Even more troublesome is that we haven't seemed to learn our lesson about the power of zoonotic viruses to seriously f\*ck with us if they have the opportunity to mutate.

The more animals out there that are infected (be they cows, farmed birds, wild birds, whatever), and the closer these animals are to each other both physically and genetically (as what happens in industrial animal ag) -- then the chances increase for the avian flu virus to mutate into something much more dangerous. It could become something that more easily hops to humans, it could become deadlier for animals or humans, or even possibly all of the above, god help us.

I have spent a little bit of time on the USDA, CDC, and FDA websites related to avian flu, and I am disappointed &amp; shocked at how little public information about infected cows and herds is available. All that is provided is the state, the type of animal infected, and the date the testing was confirmed by the feds. And what information is there most likely has a significant delay - given all of the bureaucratic hurdles and procedures around testing and reporting and whatnot.

\*\*\*\*\*  
Which brings me to my three questions for you milk producers. (Thank you if you have read this far, and thank you in advance for whatever you feel like sharing.)

1. Testing &amp; Reporting:  There is a recent USDA order requiring avian flu testing of dairy cows that are moving between states. But, at least at the federal level, there are no mandatory testing requirements if cows are not being moved from state to state. Also, as I read it, testing isn't even mandatory if a cow appears sick -- in that case the language the USDA uses is around *recommended* testing and biosecurity *guidelines.* (I assume that many states have added their own layers of requirements in addition to the Federal, so this is where I need help.).

So, my question here is about what actually happens on the ground, how avian flu testing and reporting happens for the dairy farmers here.  Do you voluntarily test periodically? Do you live in a place that requires it?  How does reporting work?

2. Disposal of Infected Milk: Given that milk that has been contaminated by avian flu can't technically be sold, I assume that it in an ideal world it is first pasteurized and then disposed of. Because if it were to be dumped in the environment, it has the potential to be a major vector for the spread of avian flu to lots of other kinds of animals. There are reported cases of other animals dying that drank raw milk infected with avian flu. The USDA, again, like the testing issue, does not require how milk should be disposed of -- it just has recommendations. 

So, what do you (or others in your industry) do with infected milk?  Do your states have additional requirements the USDA does not?

3. Overall Industry Feelings about Avian Flu:  Finally, I am curious what people who are working in the dairy industry feel about avian flu. Is there increasing concern?  Does what I wrote above resonate, or do you think I am overreacting?

It's inside of Route 128, the inner beltway of the metropolitan area, so it's pleasantly surprising that we have any local milk producers that I can support. It's definitely not a boutique or fancy brand, it's just a brand of milk that a lot of stores carry around here. I won't name them because it would feel awful to give them any bad publicity.

However, rarely when I get this milk, I notice there is a slight peanut taste which isn't very pleasant. It's still drinkable, and I don't notice it when mixed into tea, but if I just drink a glass of the milk I swear there is a slight peanut note. Is this a flavor defect that can be caused by feeding the cows a lot of peanut products, perhaps? I thought it was just a fluke the first time it happened a few months ago, but we got another gallon this week that also has it. It's only something I have ever noticed with milk from this company. 

We're a 1% milk household if the fat percentage comes into play when talking about possible milk flavor defects, if that's something that changes things.

dairy AND farmers,15oanwh,Milk price payment for farmers,dairyfarming,7,0.8,"I want first hand opinion from you guys regarding the price you get for the milk being produced on farm.
As far as it's my understanding,  a farmer gets into a contract with a processor/co-operative,  to whom they sell their milk. And for each kg of milk, the farmer is given a specific price.
Now, I have the following question.
1. For how long these contracts are for (1 year, 2 year etc) ?

I ask this because I am working on a model, to see how much milk price is given to dairy farmers in different regions in a year.

Now in some parts of the year (spring mostly) the milk price is lower as compared to  price in autumn/winter.
Now I understand, the dairy farmers are calving their cows just before spring so that their cows are giving the highest amount of milk in the time when there is abundant availability of feed. 

But what if you were to shift this calving by 4-5  month only, understandably you will have to ensure the abundance of feed in the seasons when the feed availability is less but you will be getting highest milk prices, while the herd will be producing the highest amount of milk.

I've discovered that lots of animal rights websites have listed examples of ""ex-farmer vegans"", or people who supposedly worked with livestock but then became pro animal rights supporters.

Reading through the lists, it seems that most of these people are simply individuals who grew up on a farm but became supporters of animal rights later on, but a few make the exact same claims about animal farming as militant animal rights activists.

The problem is that I'm having a heck of a time finding any dairy veterinarians that actually list their prices online. I've reached out to a dairy vet/professor who teaches at my school for help, but she's super busy and I haven't heard back yet, so I thought I'd give it a go here.

My main questions are:

What would you expect to pay in the U.S. (per hour or per animal) for a veterinarian to vaccinate your calves/cows?

How long would you expect it to take for a veterinarian to vaccinate, say, 50 animals?

I know that MOST disease prevention depends upon you all having good animal management/husbandry, but is there preventive care that you'd like veterinarians to offer that they currently don't?

Do you have a vet out for consultations on disease prevention when your animals are all healthy, or would you only call a vet when you have animal health problems?

dairy AND farmers,17dtnyq,UK Farmer question… double cream production?,dairyfarming,0,1.0,"Hi. 

Hoping someone out there can help me with this… looking online to no avail.

I’m in the US (husband from UK) and hoping to make some real double cream - greater than home use quantity so the vintage Bel Cream Maker is out… :(

I have a friend in dairy food science/production here who is telling me that reaching 48% butterfat, as is standard in UK double cream, would be very, very difficult. 

Some double cream is produced on family farms in the UK so I can’t imagine that the equipment is that specialized. I understand how milk is separated into skim/cream with a separator, but is the cream that’s collected at that point at 48% butterfat? (US guy says it’s 40% max here)

Is the butterfat percentage adjustable on the separator and does it go to 48%/higher? Is the cream from the initial separation somehow processed again to concentrate butterfat if it’s not high enough?

Another thought is that fresh, unprocessed American milk starts at a lower butterfat percentage overall and that I might need to seek milk from Jersey or similar cows.

I just can’t understand why he’s telling me it’s so hard when double cream is everywhere in England - both mass and farm produced…

Any detailed info about the process would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",2023-10-22,

* What is the current situation economically? Are profits lacking substantially when it comes to selling product?
* From what I have gathered so far, there appears to be an idea of introducing a quota system similar to Canada. Will that make a direct impact on the industry in terms of selling price? If so, would that allow for a comfortable living wage?
* Who or what is responsible for the sharp decline in profits? Is it a single group or multiple, government,  dairy farmers, etc.?
* Can President Trump's NAFTA plan assist in the recovery or is the intended audience too niche to make a real impact?
* Will there ever be hope for a full recovery of the industry in the future or do things still appear bleak?

dairy AND farmers,h8g0qh,I am poorly prepared for the modern dairy industry.,dairyfarming,16,0.91,"My passion is in the dairy industry. I plan to make a lifelong career out of it. However...

The farm that I used to work at was a 60-head tie-stall operation that had more or less been run the same way for the past fifty years. I worked there for two years, and was very good at my job. I was a fast milker, great with the calves (calves are my primary focus), and just generally knew that barn and its operations inside and out. Unfortunately, the farmer decided to retire and sold his registered Holstein herd at auction. It was very sad and I miss it every day.

For about a month, I've been working at a 2,000-head operation. It's vastly different, and I am having a very hard time adjusting. The interviews that I had and previous discussions with the farmer made it seem I was going to be working with the calves, which would've been perfect for me as 1). it's calves, and 2). it's methodical work that consists of the same tasks each day, which I appreciate in a job. However, I am not working with the calves, as the lady who holds the position decided to stay on; I am working in the barn essentially doing chores and acting as an extra set of hands when needed. I was told that if the calf-feeder position opens again, I can have it no question.

I've narrowed down the two primary areas I am struggling in, and brought them to the attention of my bosses. However, any advice from anyone who was in a similar position would be appreciated.

1). The biggest thing... time management. I'm too damn slow. The tasks that take everyone else 20 minutes take me an hour. I'm getting better, but scraping, shoveling, and the like all take me far too long. I realize that a big part of this is because I've rarely driven tractor and other equipment before working here (at my old farm ""boys ran the tractors, girls fed calves""). And the rest of it I think is probably my technique and the fact that I am very hesitant to work by myself for fear of screwing up, and constantly need reassurance and things that I should damn well know by now explained to me a million times. At my old farm, the farmer pushed us to take our time and go slow so it was ""done right."" Here, you have to be a NASCAR-eligible tractor driver and do everything satisfactory. I've always been one who's work output reflects, ""Go slow, world class. Go fast, half-assed."" I'm just trying to be fast enough and do a good job!

2). Receiving and interpreting directions. This one is mainly my fault. I am not a fast learner. I prefer to be told how to do things in detailed verbal instruction and then shown a few times, so that I can fully grasp the task I'm performing. I fully understand that the people I work with now don't have time to do that, so I'm trying to learn the ""crash-course"" way. There's also a language barrier between me and many of my co-workers, and I have a hell of a time interpreting the instructions I'm given through vague instruction and body language. I am very frustrated with myself because I keep messing up the most basic duties because I don't understand what I am supposed to be doing, and I frustrate the people I'm working with by continually bothering them because ""I don't get it.""

I'm just completely at a loss and actively dread going to work now. I don't think I'm doing as poorly as I have led myself to believe, but I really would appreciate any advice to improve that you can offer. I want so much to be good at this job and enjoy going to work again, and I feel guilty about how badly I am performing given that I was hired on good faith due to my reputation at my old job. I'm not the only one struggling with adjusting to a new farm environment; I recently talked to one of my co-workers from my old farm and he had a job at a 1,000-head farm, where he lasted a mere two weeks before quitting because he felt he couldn't do it.",2020-06-13,

I apologize for this kind of odd post, but I couldn’t live with myself without trying.

I’m a 30 year old man from the PNW looking for a dairy farm. I’m originally from a small town in the midwest, and come from a long line of dairy farmers on both sides of the family. I am gay, and unfortunately am no longer close with my family. When i came out to them after high school, everyone became cold and I feel like I was forgotten about. The same can be said for most of my friends and neighbors.

Ive spent the last 10 years of my life trying to run from my “past”, and find myself. Ive been chasing white collar jobs in big cities. Trying to find myself as a gay person has lead me to a life that doesn’t feel like myself.

Lately I've been really obsessed with the idea of taking some time away from my job to pursue the idea of farm work. Farming still feels really natural for me, but due to my current job type, my need to live in cities, and lack of connection to home, i feel completely locked out and it feels a little depressing. I also feel that as a gay man, i am pretty much out of luck due to stereotypes and social norms.

There is one other aspect to this desire. I enjoy manual labor and dirty work. The idea of actually working.  

Im not really sure where to go with this kind of desire, but I hope it finds someone well. At the end of the day, I would really just love to feel a part of something and immerse myself in an industry that I feel like I've been locked out of. I want to work hard (really) and learn. Im not looking for compensation or anything. I would just been incredibly honored by the opportunity. And I can’t stress the work part of this enough. I really just want to work hard and get dirty!

**Refresher:** Milk sales are regulated by Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) that set milk prices based on the class (intended use) of the milk.

Class I milk prices (the jug in your fridge) are [calculated](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cueWFua2VlZmFybWNyZWRpdC5jb20lMkZibG9nJTJGanVseS0yMDIwJTJGYS1uZWdhdGl2ZS1wcGQtZXhwbGFpbmVkJTNGY2F0ZWdvcnlpZCUzRDE3&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3053) based on the average of cheese (Class III) and powder milk (Class IV), with an added premium.

**Enter the ‘rona:** COVID-19 messed with the milk market big time in 2020. As cheese prices influenced fluid prices, dairy farmers took the ultimate hit. The NMPF’s proposal seeks to change price structuring...and make up for some 2020 losses.

But some producers are saying, “*hold your* *~~horses~~* *holsteins*.”

In a letter sent to Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack, five Midwestern [dairy groups](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cud2lzZmFybWVyLmNvbSUyRnN0b3J5JTJGbmV3cyUyRjIwMjElMkYwNSUyRjE0JTJGZGFpcnktZ3JvdXBzLXN0cmVzcy1ob2xpc3RpYy1hcHByb2FjaC10by1taWxrLXByaWNpbmctcmVmb3JtJTJGNTA5MTU3NDAwMSUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3054) put forth their own proposal dubbed *Class III Plus*.

The Class III Plus crew says that their [proposal](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYWdkYWlseS5jb20lMkZsaXZlc3RvY2slMkZkYWlyeS1ncm91cHMtY2xhc3MtaWlpLXBsdXMtYmV0dGVyLW1pbGstcHJpY2luZyUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3055) provides future stability, allows for better risk management, and does not increase long-term consumer prices.

**Soundbite:** ""*\[The NMPF proposal\] attempts to claw back lost revenue in the short term and leaves larger problems unsolved. Our organizations prefer sensible changes that will last for decades,*"" noted Amy Penterman, president of the Dairy Business Association.

**Bottom line:** The groups aren’t pushing for an emergency FMMO hearing. But if it happens, they say the discussion needs to be broader in scope and “tackle more than just Class I pricing.”

We are researchers from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Canada and the [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://en.ufsc.br/) in Brazil.

Young farm animals, including dairy calves, are often separated from the dam far earlier than what occurs under natural conditions. Farms animals are also sometimes subjected to painful procedures like hot-iron dehorning. The aim of this study was to better understand the effects of these routine procedures on the emotions of animals. One way to investigate mood states is to look for evidence of judgement biases. We tested for cognitive biases in calves before and after separation from the cow and dehorning, and found diminished responding to intermediate, ambiguous stimuli (evidence of a pessimistic response) following both physical pain and social loss. This paper illustrates one approach to investigating emotional states in animals, and draws parallels in the emotional experience of physical and social pain.

Last year, I retired from Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (the only chemist on the faculty!), where I founded and directed the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy (&lt;http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CIERP&gt;) for 22 years. I supervised many masters’ and doctoral students during that time, including the co-chair of the Paris climate negotiations. I continue to work on climate science and policy, energy, water, forests and oceans to develop scientifically valid and effective strategies and policies. I served as a lead author on five IPCC reports over a 19-year period. Until recently I served as Chief Scientist at Earthwatch Institute (&lt;http://earthwatch.org/&gt;) and continue to serve as the Chair of their Science Committee. I also serve on the board of directors of Woods Hole Research Center (&lt;http://whrc.org/&gt;), ranked as the most influential climate think tank for the past two years, and several additional environmental science and consensus building organizations.

The science of climate change is complex, and the politics are more so. I have always found the interaction between the two to be fascinating, and remember being shocked as a young scientist that science did not always determine the political outcome of a policy process. I want to share with you the role of science in the outcome of the Paris climate negotiation that just ended on December 11th, 2015.

A bit of history: back in the 1980s, a group of scientists convinced some governments that based on their research, the release of heat trapping gases into the atmosphere would heat the earth to a point where there could be uncontrollable and irreversible warming with devastating consequences for all life, including humans. This science prompted two actions. The first was to create the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide scientific input to governments on the science, impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change. The second was to negotiate an international treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that was signed by 154 nations in 1992. The Paris negotiations were the 21st meeting of the parties to the original treaty, and its actions both utilized and ignored science in the final outcome.

I invite you to join me in a discussion about how science and policy came together and diverged over issues like the 2oC global temperature goal during the recent Paris talks.

I'll be back at 1 pm EST (10 AM PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!

**EDIT IN CLOSING:**

Thank you all for your engagement, and your thoughtful questions. It has been very gratifying to hear your concerns. Let me close with one final thought. So many actions to address climate change have many additional benefits for providing sustainable energy to all and lift people out of poverty. There would be far less damage to the planet and our health if we can make the shift away form fossil fuels. As I said earlier, we also need to do Restorative Development to mobilize the biosphere so that we improve our forests and land quality every time we use them instead of constantly degrading them. Perhaps, you will enjoy one of my favorite cartoons as a closing.

Young farm animals, including dairy calves, are often separated from the dam far earlier than what occurs under natural conditions. Farms animals are also sometimes subjected to painful procedures like hot-iron dehorning. The aim of this study was to better understand the effects of these routine procedures on the emotions of animals. One way to investigate mood states is to look for evidence of judgement biases. We tested for cognitive biases in calves before and after separation from the cow and dehorning, and found diminished responding to intermediate, ambiguous stimuli (evidence of a pessimistic response) following both physical pain and social loss. This paper illustrates one approach to investigating emotional states in animals, and draws parallels in the emotional experience of physical and social pain.

Its message:](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/does-the-movie-fed-up-make-sense/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_reader=feedly&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=does-the-movie-fed-up-make-sense)

    There is a worldwide epidemic of obesity.
    It is endangering our children.
    Increased sugar consumption is responsible.
    The food industry is responsible for our increased sugar consumption because it puts hidden sugar in processed foods, bombards us with advertising, favors profits over health, and lobbies against regulation.
    The government is responsible because it has failed to control the food industry.

The film has received mostly positive reviews and has been called the Inconvenient Truth of the health movement. It was written and directed by Stephanie Soechtig, whose earlier films attacked GMO foods and the bottled water industry, and narrated by Katie Couric, who “gave anti-vaccine ideas a shot” on her talk show in late 2013.

The film shows families struggling with childhood obesity and “experts” expressing their opinions. Their selection of “experts” is heavy on politicians and journalists and light on nutrition scientists.

Is Sugar Really the Cause of the Obesity Epidemic?

Between 1971 and 2000, the prevalence of obesity in the United States doubled. During that time, fat consumption decreased, carbohydrate consumption rose, and average calorie intake rose (from 2450 to 2618 for men, and from 1542 to 1877 for women); the film blames sugar, but one could argue that total calorie intake was to blame.

Correlation is not causation, even when there is a strong correlation like the one between the rise in autism diagnoses and the rise in the sales of organic food. There is no such strong correlation between sugar consumption and obesity, much less any convincing evidence of causation.

Sugar consumption has actually decreased around the world even as the rate of obesity has continued to climb. Between 1999 and 2008, American consumption of added sugars decreased from 100 g/d to 76 g/d, mainly due to a reduction in soda consumption.

This webpage lists per capita sugar consumption by country, and it clearly does not correlate with rates of obesity in those countries. Countries with higher per capita sugar consumption than the US include Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Iceland, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, UK, and Venezuela. According to this source there are 17 countries with higher rates of obesity than the US. Not a single one of those countries has a higher per capita sugar consumption than the US.

There are other sources with different numbers, and these statistics don’t tell us much, because there are so many possible confounders such as lifestyle, total calorie intake, fiber, the type of sugar, hidden sugar in prepared foods, consumption of an otherwise nutritious diet, etc. The point is that it’s premature to make the kind of definitive pronouncements that the film makes about the role of sugar.

Gary Taubes makes a strong case for low-carb diets both for weight loss and health, but he admits that his hypothesis has not yet been properly tested. Chris Voight did an informal test of its exact opposite, a carbs-only diet: he ate nothing but potatoes for 60 days. According to Taubes’ low-carb theories he should have gained weight and raised his blood sugar, but instead he lost 21 pounds and lowered his blood sugar. His cholesterol and triglyceride levels dropped; he felt well and had plenty of energy.

The sugar/obesity hypothesis has not been properly tested either. There are plenty of examples of people who eat a lot of sugar and processed foods and don’t gain weight. In fact, one obese boy in the film complains that his brother eats the same way he does but doesn’t gain weight. There are plenty of examples of people who have lost weight and kept it off by reducing calorie intake and increasing exercise. We know some of the factors involved in successful weight loss, and eliminating sugar is not on the list.

Restaurants contribute to obesity by providing high-calorie food choices, large servings, and super-sized drinks. Fast food restaurants get a lot of blame, but John Cisna lost 56 pounds in 6 months while eating all his meals at McDonald’s. He counted calories and stuck to a 2000 calorie a day limit.

We don’t know that eliminating sugar from the diet is an effective strategy by itself. A family in the film eliminated sugar from their diet (they said they were “detoxing”!) and lost weight, but that could have been because they ate fewer total calories, and we don’t know that they would have lost any less weight if those fewer calories had included some calories from sugar. And the teenage boy lost weight but then gained it right back. What went wrong?

Colin Campbell of the Center for Nutritional Studies points out that the evidence showing sugar to be a major factor in obesity is relatively weak and is confounded by total calorie intake and other factors. He says:

    I know of no evidence that were we to eliminate all sugar from our diets, presumably leaving the rest of the diet the same, we could rid ourselves of disease and restore our health.

The Film Gets a Lot of Things Wrong

I was going to do some further fact checking, but Google saved me the trouble. I discovered that two writers at Food Insight had already analyzed the claims in Fed Up and shown that the filmmakers got many of their facts wrong. They give these examples:

    “This year for the first time in the history of the world, more people will die from the effects of obesity than from starvation.” Not true: three times as many die of starvation.
    “For the first time in 200 years, the current generation of children are expected to live shorter lives than their parents.” Expected by whom? According to the CDC and the Census Bureau, life expectancies are on an uninterrupted upward trajectory that is expected to continue rising until at least 2020.
    While fitness club memberships more than doubled, the obesity rate also doubled. A meaningless comparison that is intended to suggest that we are helpless to do anything about our weight.
    It rejects the concept of energy balance, but the scientific evidence clearly shows that it is possible to lose weight by decreasing calorie intake and increasing calorie expenditure.
    Dr. Robert Lustig gets a lot of screen time. He says that there is “really good data” that “a calorie is not a calorie,” in that the “toxicity” of sugars is an inherent and unique contributor to obesogenicity. “When your liver gets that big sugar rush… it has no choice but to turn it into fat immediately.” His language is inflammatory, demonizing sugar as toxic and addictive. Lustig’s views are inconsistent with mainstream scientific opinions based on all the available evidence. Dr. David Katz of the Yale Prevention Research Center characterizes Lustig’s theories as “humbug” and explains why.
    “Between 1977 and 2000, Americans have doubled their daily intake of sugar.” Not true: Americans are eating more total calories but have not doubled the calories from sugar.
    “Over 95 percent of all Americans will be overweight or obese in two decades.” No, obesity prevalence has leveled off since 2003 and the forecasted trend-line is virtually flat.
    It claims that consuming a single soda per day increases one’s risk of diabetes by 22 percent. Sugar doesn’t cause diabetes; the film presents a simplistic caricature of the relationship between sugar and diabetes.
    The film says the pledge of food companies to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the marketplace amounts to “nothing,” a mere 14 calories a day per person. Actually, they have already removed 6.4 trillion calories, ahead of schedule and more than 400 percent of the original goal. The resulting reduction of 78 calories a day per person is probably more than enough to meet the Healthy People 2020 target for obesity reduction.

This review concludes by saying the central claims of the film are shadings of the truth, sins of omission, and outright fabrication. It says the film’s “obsessive focus on a single nutrient actually could cause more harm than good, in that overconsumption of any macronutrient can lead to overweight and obesity.” It offers credible evidence and provides links to additional resources.

At Reason.com, Baylen Linnekin points out that the film overwhelmingly features supporters of increased food regulation, and non-supporters are treated unfairly. David Allison is asked for his opinion on the contribution of sugar sweetened beverages to obesity, and when he asks for a moment to collect his thoughts, the editing cuts him off and makes him look foolish.

In the film, Senator Tom Harkin asks how the food industry executives can sleep at night. I find that ironic. He supported farm bills that pay billions of dollars in subsidies to farmers in his home state Iowa, which leads the nation in high fructose corn syrup production. Harkin is a major advocate of alternative medicine who has been instrumental in legislation such as creating the NCCAM, a travesty and a waste of taxpayer dollars. He is so ignorant of how science works that he complained that the NCCAM has been disproving things rather than doing its intended job of “seeking out and approving.” He has been characterized on this blog as “waging a war on science.” I wonder how Harkin can sleep at night.
What Can Be Done to Improve the American Diet?

I think we can all agree that the typical American diet is not healthy. It provides too much processed food, convenience food, sodas, red meat, salt, sugars, and calories; and it is deficient in fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Sugar is only one part of the obesity problem, a part that may be due to its contribution to total calorie intake rather than anything inherently bad about sugar. No one would argue that we shouldn’t try to reduce sugar consumption; the question is how to accomplish that.

The film’s comparison to tobacco is interesting. For a long time, the tobacco industry misled the pubic about the dangers of smoking. Tobacco advertising dropped when equal time was required for anti-smoking information. Societal attitudes changed rapidly for tobacco thanks to public information campaigns. Legislation has contributed to a decrease in smoking, but I would argue that legislation would not have been possible without a change in public perceptions.

I think the general public is well aware of the need to control weight, and instead of trying to control their eating habits by passing laws to control the food industry, we might do better to educate them about how to eat a healthier diet. There is so much they don’t understand. The film shows tearful families unable to lose weight and trying so hard — but their efforts include things like switching from regular Hot Pockets to a low-fat version. There are many flavors of Lean Pockets, but the very first one I looked up contained the equivalent of 3-4 tsp of sugar and a whopping 655 calories. Obese teenagers are shown lamenting their inability to lose weight while gorging on cereal, finishing large bags of potato chips to “savor the flavor,” and choosing hamburgers and fries for lunch at school. One is shown making what he thinks is a “healthy lunch” to take to school: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! These people desperately want to adopt healthier eating habits, but they have no idea how to go about it. How can we best help them?

People complain that they weren’t able to lose weight by reducing calories, but some of them don’t realize that they never actually reduced calories enough to get results. I once had an overweight 13-year-old boy as a patient. I asked what he usually ate for lunch, and we calculated that his daily cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake added up to over 1000 calories. I asked if he would consider bringing a lower calorie sack lunch from home, and he enthusiastically agreed. He had never even thought of that option. I had an adult patient who couldn’t understand why she hadn’t lost weight when she was eating mostly yogurt. She thought yogurt was “diet food” so she could eat as much of it as she wanted. When I asked her to read the label, she was astounded to learn that each container of yogurt had 240 calories.

Efforts are already underway to improve school lunches and remove junk food vending machines from schools. That’s a step in the right direction. Agatha Raisin, a character in a delicious series of mystery novels by M. C. Beaton, brags that she loves to cook, but her idea of cooking is sticking a TV dinner in the microwave. A lot of our young people grow up with similar ideas about what it means to cook. Why not require Home Ec classes in our schools? They could teach nutrition, menu planning, and meal preparation from scratch with fresh ingredients. Students might learn to think of healthier options when it comes to planning what to do for dinner.

To my mind, it’s not just a matter of educating children, but of educating the parents who buy and serve the food their children eat at home, educating the parents who think you can lose weight by switching from Hot Pockets to Lean Pockets. Just as information campaigns educated the public about smoking, they could educate the public about healthy food choices, hidden sugars, and calorie content of various foods. Even without legislation, a public outcry and grass roots movements would be enough to change food manufacturing. The food industry exists to please its customers and has provided us with easy, timesaving, attractive options that are hard to resist. What if the general public learned to buy less processed food, to read labels, to avoid hidden sugars, to be aware of how many calories they are ingesting, and to enjoy cooking at home. If they did that, market forces would make the food industry adapt. If companies wanted to keep profits up, they would have to be creative about providing healthier products. Just think how quickly they responded to public enthusiasms like gluten-free and low-carb.

People naturally tend to eat the way their parents ate, the way their culture eats. It can be hard for them to even imagine other ways of eating. My parents grew up on farms and ate the way their own parents and grandparents had always eaten. I grew up thinking the ideal meal was meat, potatoes, a green vegetable, a yellow vegetable, bread and butter, a sugary dessert, and milk for a beverage. Last night I cooked dinner from scratch, using several ingredients that never crossed the threshold of my mother’s kitchen, including red quinoa, chickpeas, collard greens, olive oil, yogurt, and limes. I used to see items like those in the grocery store and pass them by; it never would have occurred to me to cook with them because I had no experience with them and wouldn’t have known what to do with them. We can’t expect people to think outside the box of the traditional American family dinner table and the fast food restaurant without some help. My horizons have been hugely expanded by subscribing to the Blue Apron program, which has me cooking from scratch with a variety of ingredients like heirloom vegetables and exotic foods from other cultures (many of which I had never even heard of) and trying out new cooking techniques. Blue Apron is expensive and is not something that could be recommended for everyone, but I can see how school programs and media campaigns might be able to accomplish something similar.

I favor education over regulation. I’m not against regulating the food industry, but I would like to see proposals tested before they are widely implemented. Providing nutrition information on menus seemed like a great idea, but it has had minimal impact on food choices in real-world settings. Many thousands of young people were put through abstinence-only sex education programs before we realized they were ineffective and might even be doing more harm than good. We can’t just assume that any proposed remedy for the obesity epidemic will work. No matter how slam-dunk it sounds, it must be tested using scientific methods.
Conclusion

The film’s thesis, that sugar has caused the obesity epidemic, is not well supported by evidence. It is a partial truth that the filmmakers have dogmatically represented as the whole truth, with nary a hint of nuance. And it’s not fair to demonize the food industry. It has done a lot of good by providing a greater variety of safer food to more people for lower prices. We must share the responsibility for their shortcomings, because their less healthy offerings were created in response to public demand, and large numbers of people have chosen to buy those products because they don’t know any better.

The film will undoubtedly do some good by helping raise public awareness of childhood obesity and of hidden sugars in processed foods. I only wish it could have done so without misrepresenting the facts and without the bias and hype in support of the filmmakers’ political agenda of increasing food regulation. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I enjoy an occasional sugary treat and fast food meal, and I appreciate the convenience of packaged, processed foods when I don’t have a lot of time to shop and cook. I see no compelling reason to think it is impossible for people to lose weight on a diet that is overall nutritious and calorie controlled but that allows small amounts of even the “worst” foods.

There is some extremely interesting probiotic yoghurtmilk products called ""Fil"" from northern sweden.

""Hälsofil"" (Loosely translates to Healthy yoghurtmilk)

Its even listed as nature derived medicine by swedish law and can be prescribed for certain issues

Unfortunately the website is only in swedish but you can use google translate to look around in it:

What I've noticed since swapping out a litre of milk a day to a litre of healthy yoghurtmilk is that my hunger pangs has lessened and I just feel less stressed.

Digestion improved too. But my shits are a little uncomfortably brightly coloured compared to usual.

If you live in USA or the EU there are some swedish specialist stores that let you try it out

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars

The best part of ""fil"" is that you can make your own once you got a first pack. Just follow this recipy:

----------------------------------

How to: swedish ""Fil"" milk

BUY ""YMP"" - Purchase buy a packet of filmjölk (Like verum hälsofil / a-fil / Långfil) of a natural (nonflavoured) type that you like and that contains live bacterial culture. It will be used as a seed to grow the beneficial bacteria strain from it and thus get the right taste and texture on your ""fil"" milk. You only use a little bit of it each time you make a batch of Fil milk, so the package will last for a long time. Freeze the excess divided into small air tight packages, then you have new starter if you end up needing it. You can use any pasteurized milk you want, but it will be best with a fatter variant (eg standard 4% fat milk).

Heat the regular milk first. Heat until it is almost boiling. You should see small bubbles in the saucepan, but it should not boil. The heating will kill all unwanted bacteria so that the good bacteria can get the upper hand. If you use pasteurized buttermilk and clean tools, you can skip step this step.

MIX IN THE YMP - Let the milk to cool to room temperature. Then mix in a little starter fil milk/YMP. Some tablespoons of it per liter of milk are usually good.

LET IT REST - Let the mixture stand at room temperature overnight (or until it is ready).

STORE COLD - Keep it in the refrigerator when it is ready, otherwise it will continue to ferment and become alcoholic. Totally worth it though but kinda tricky to get the right alcoholic content. If the ready-made ""fil"" milk tastes or smells bad then you should not eat it. In that case, it will be bad and you will have to throw it out and restart with a fresh batch.

SAVE SMALL BATCHES - Once you have eaten almost the entire film milk, you save only one slice that you use as grafting on the next rate (instead of using bacon milk). You can continue to grab the last sludge for any length of time, so you do not have to start over again with buying new ""Fil"" milk/YMP.


----------------------------------

It actually started out as a traditional dish where farmers would keep a starter like some bakers would keep sourdough starters. Then they shared the starters with eachother for taste and to replace a batch thats gone bad.

Ymp is just a swedish name for the piece of the ""Fil"" milk that you save to make new Fil milk with.

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars. I can dig it up or get some email/phone numbers for you if youre interested.

You can always email the verum folks over here if youre interested in more recipies or starter packs or whatever else: forum@norrmejerier.se

Theres more contact info over here: https://verum.se/kontakt/

If you want to try this then I think A-fil and Långfil are the easiest to do it with. Verum Hälsofil can be done but it contains so many millions of bacteria per dl that it tend to grow rather quickly so you need to keep a closer eye on it.

For the sake of not introducing bad bacteria I would stick to using small frozen packets of the initial Fil milk. Make sure they are air tight and has as little air in the bag as possible. Then put the bags collected in an airtight container.

----------------------------------

How to: swedish ""Fil"" milk

BUY ""YMP"" - Purchase buy a packet of filmjölk (Like verum hälsofil / a-fil / Långfil) of a natural (nonflavoured) type that you like and that contains live bacterial culture. It will be used as a seed to grow the beneficial bacteria strain from it and thus get the right taste and texture on your ""fil"" milk. You only use a little bit of it each time you make a batch of Fil milk, so the package will last for a long time. Freeze the excess divided into small air tight packages, then you have new starter if you end up needing it. You can use any pasteurized milk you want, but it will be best with a fatter variant (eg standard 4% fat milk).

Heat the regular milk first. Heat until it is almost boiling. You should see small bubbles in the saucepan, but it should not boil. The heating will kill all unwanted bacteria so that the good bacteria can get the upper hand. If you use pasteurized buttermilk and clean tools, you can skip step this step.

MIX IN THE YMP - Let the milk to cool to room temperature. Then mix in a little starter fil milk/YMP. Some tablespoons of it per liter of milk are usually good.

LET IT REST - Let the mixture stand at room temperature overnight (or until it is ready).

STORE COLD - Keep it in the refrigerator when it is ready, otherwise it will continue to ferment and become alcoholic. Totally worth it though but kinda tricky to get the right alcoholic content. If the ready-made ""fil"" milk tastes or smells bad then you should not eat it. In that case, it will be bad and you will have to throw it out and restart with a fresh batch.

SAVE SMALL BATCHES - Once you have eaten almost the entire film milk, you save only one slice that you use as grafting on the next rate (instead of using bacon milk). You can continue to grab the last sludge for any length of time, so you do not have to start over again with buying new ""Fil"" milk/YMP.


----------------------------------

It actually started out as a traditional dish where farmers would keep a starter like some bakers would keep sourdough starters. Then they shared the starters with eachother for taste and to replace a batch thats gone bad.

Ymp is just a swedish name for the piece of the ""Fil"" milk that you save to make new Fil milk with.

If you want to try this then I think A-fil and Långfil are the easiest to do it with. Verum Hälsofil can be done but it contains so many millions of bacteria per dl that it tend to grow rather quickly so you need to keep a closer eye on it.

For the sake of not introducing bad bacteria I would stick to using small frozen packets of the initial Fil milk. Make sure they are air tight and has as little air in the bag as possible. Then put the bags collected in an airtight container.

As of late I've started to theorize about what a diet would look like that placed emphasis on mental/emotional well-being before any physical pay off (weight loss, muscle gain, et cetera...).

Obviously physical well-being and mental health are not exactly seperate entities but your hard pressed to find diets that value cognition over chiseled abs. So the question I pose is this...

What foods, dietary habits, vitamins, supplements et cetera.. would you include in a theoretical diet that disregards the physique in the interest of cognition and emotional well-being.

To clarify, I'm not asking for a list of ""comfort foods"" here. A diet of chocolate and ice cream may make one feel better momentarily but no ones brain is going to work better on it. Nor is anyone going to yield a strong emotional state as a result.

So I'm curious. What would your theoretical ""brain"" diet look like.

Mine (thus far) looks like this:

-Lower calorie intake (1400-1700)
-Intermittent Fasting (one large meal a day)
-Run/Jog about 30 miles a week or more.
-No refined sugar, grains, dairy or meat (causes cravings impacting mental health)
-No soy or chocolate (I am allergic/intolerant)
-Minimal table salt (celtic sea salt is fine)
-Lots of kale, spinach, collard and mustard greens. Next in line is a ton of broccoli, peppers and chili's and celery. Almonds, cashews, coconut milk/cream (unsweetened), seaweed and nutritional yeast. Hemp protein and brown rice protein (both plain unflavored).
-drinking water and coffee only
-spicing everything with lots of black pepper, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, dill, cardamon, chili pepper, basil, savory, oregeno, and sage. also using vinegar for flavor.
-Supplement with Omega 3 (fish oil), DHEA, Baccopa (optional not constant), Glycine, Glutamine (optional not constant), b-vitamins (mostly 6, 12 and 1) and DLPA.

Bear in mind this is MY theoretical ""brain"" diet. I don't suggest this for anyone else, nor do I believe this to be the most nutritionally sound plan for physical well-being.

So my whole life I've *believed* I was lactose intolerant. Whenever I'd consume milk I'd bloat, have horrid gas and abdominal pain, and sometimes I'd wish I would just throw up because it hurt so bad. I've operated under this assumption for the majority of my life and just avoided milk, save for a few splurges which were definitely uncomfortable but totally worth it. I drank Lactaid milk without any issue, eat margarine instead of butter (even though it's icky) and typically go without everything else dairy (ice cream, cream cheese, cheese in general because vegan cheese is nasty).


But I was recently in a position to have some raw milk. I've read studies that people who are lactose intolerant find they tolerate raw milk just fine, so I gave it a go. I drank the stuff for an extended period of time (several months) with no symptoms! It was awesome! 


Then I started reading that foods like aged hard cheeses and butter typically don't have any lactose in them. I was so encouraged by the raw milk results that I gave that a go as well, with horrible consequences. The bloating, gas, and abdominal pain was pretty bad... I may as well have just ingested a glass of pasteurized milk for all the symptoms I experienced.


Does anyone know why this is? Why raw milk is fine, but products that say right on them that they contain 0g of lactose (thinking about [Cabot cheese](https://www.cabotcheese.coop/extra-sharp-cheddar-cheese-dairy-bar)) result in lactose intolerance symptoms? And from there, why something like butter, which [apparently should be OK](http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2012/07/some_dairy_products_may_be_ok.html) also results in the same symptoms!


I've done my research and these are internal symptoms, not external, so it's not a milk allergy. I just don't know what it could be, and my google searching is not really yielding any results. I did read that margarine has been linked to allergies, but I don't know if that could be the cause of my inconsistent dairy intolerance.

dairy AND yield,52ggrj,Food Industry Funding of Nutrition Research,nutrition,2,0.94,"Hot off the press - just published today:

https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251

by Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH in *JAMA Intern Medicine*, September 12, 2016

&gt; Industry-sponsored nutrition research, like that of research sponsored by the tobacco, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, almost invariably produces results that confirm the benefits or lack of harm of the sponsor’s products, even when independently sponsored research comes to opposite conclusions.1 Although considerable evidence demonstrates that those industries deliberately influenced the design, results, and interpretation of the studies they paid for,2 much less is known about the influence of food-company sponsorship on nutrition research. Typically, the disclosure statements of sponsored nutrition studies state that the funder had no role in their design, conduct, interpretation, writing, or publication. Without a “smoking gun” it is difficult to prove otherwise.

&gt; In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Kearns and colleagues3 report on having found a smoking gun. From a deep dive into archival documents from the 1950s and 1960s, they have produced compelling evidence that a sugar trade association not only paid for but also initiated and influenced research expressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Although studies at that time indicated a relationship between high-sugar diets and CHD risk, the sugar association preferred scientists and policymakers to focus on the role of dietary fat and cholesterol. The association paid the equivalent of more than $48 000 in today’s dollars to 3 nutrition professors—at Harvard no less—to publish a research review that would refute evidence linking sugars to CHD.

&gt; The sponsored review appeared in 2 parts in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. Its authors acknowledged support from the industry-funded Nutrition Foundation, but they did not mention the sugar association’s specific funding of their review. Their first article demonstrates a close correlation between sugar and fat “consumption” (actually amounts in the food supply) and mortality in 14 countries (Figure).4 To minimize the association with sugar, the authors seem to have cherry-picked existing data. Despite their having previously published studies linking both fats and sugars to CHD risk, their review gave far more credence to studies implicating saturated fat than it did to those implicating sugars.

&gt; The documents leave little doubt that the intent of the industry-funded review was to reach a foregone conclusion. The investigators knew what the funder expected, and produced it. Whether they did this deliberately, unconsciously, or because they genuinely believed saturated fat to be the greater threat is unknown. But science is not supposed to work this way. The documents make this review seem more about public relations than science.

&gt; This 50-year-old incident may seem like ancient history, but it is quite relevant, not least because it answers some questions germane to our current era. Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues. In 2015, the New York Times obtained emails revealing Coca-Cola’s cozy relationships with sponsored researchers who were conducting studies aimed at minimizing the effects of sugary drinks on obesity.5 Even more recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how a candy trade association funded and influenced studies to show that children who eat sweets have healthier body weights than those who do not.6 The results of such studies have obvious implications for public health.

&gt; For this reason, it is of more than academic interest to find out when food companies began to fund research for public relations purposes. Fred Stare, then chair of Harvard’s nutrition department and senior author of the 1967 review, began soliciting donations from food companies in the early 1940s but insisted that these be unrestricted and pooled into a common fund for research and education.7 If earlier examples to the contrary occurred, they were not disclosed. If nothing else, the analysis by Kearns et al3 makes it clear why full disclosure of funding sources is essential.

&gt; In addition, their study is highly relevant to ongoing debates about the relative harm of fats and sugars. By 1967, as the Figure shows, both sugar and saturated fat had been identified as mortality risk factors. But for decades following the funded review, scientists and dietary guidelines focused on reducing saturated fat as the primary strategy for CHD prevention. They also advised consuming sugars in moderation, but mainly to prevent tooth decay. Today, the balance has shifted to less concern about fat and much greater concern about sugars.

&gt; It is worth noting that this debate focuses on sugars and saturated fats rather than on the foods that contain them. This approach, termed “nutritionism” to refer to the reductive use of single nutritional factors to stand for foods and dietary patterns, is inherently misleading.8 In excess, both sugars and saturated fat are markers of Western dietary patterns high in calories from meat, processed foods, and sugary drinks, all associated with increased chronic disease risk.9

&gt; As George Santayana famously said in Reason of Common Sense (1905), “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Today, it is almost impossible to keep up with the range of food companies sponsoring research—from makers of the most highly processed foods, drinks, and supplements to producers of dairy foods, meats, fruits, and nuts—typically yielding results favorable to the sponsor’s interests.1 Food company sponsorship, whether or not intentionally manipulative, undermines public trust in nutrition science, contributes to public confusion about what to eat, and compromises Dietary Guidelines in ways that are not in the best interest of public health.

&gt; Kearns et al3 urge policymakers to view industry-funded studies with some skepticism. This is excellent advice. Disclosure of funding sources helps but is not sufficient to address the potential conflicts that can occur with such funding. These authors3 have done the nutrition science community a great public service by bringing this historical example to light. May it serve as a warning not only to policymakers, but also to researchers, clinicians, peer reviewers, journal editors, and journalists of the need to consider the harm to scientific credibility and public health when dealing with studies funded by food companies with vested interests in the results—and to find better ways to fund such studies and to prevent, disclose, and manage potentially conflicted interests.",2016-09-12,

If yes than, The only disadvantage that it’s unflavored and I will need to try to play with it to see how to flavor it,  and my idea is this: 
I thought about using some sugar free substitutes and maybe use a fruit and mix the hydrolysed whey with water , If it works then I will have my “own” clear whey less than half of the price, sounds good to me but I’m not sure if it will actually work (I know it will not be really the same flavor as clear whey but maybe if it dissolves well in water I will find a solution to the flavor)

The global health group has previously advised a lower sugar intake, but stopped short of backing tax measures.
Several countries, including Mexico and Hungary, already tax added sugar products.
South Africa is introducing a sugar tax next year. It's the only country in Africa to do so.
The WHO said it wants to see lower consumption of ""free sugars"", which it said will lower incidences of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.
""Free sugars"" are all the different types of sugar in the diet, except for the sugars that are found naturally in fruit and milk.
The WHO's nutrition director, Dr Francesco Branca, said ""nutritionally, people don't need any sugar in their diet"".
He recommended sugar intake be kept below 10% of a person's total calorie intake - and preferably below 5%.
However, the group said taxation or other financial measures should be used only on items ""for which healthier alternatives are available"".
Its findings are based on a meeting of global experts and a review of the available evidence.
The report also found that government subsidies for fruit and vegetables - which lower prices - can increase the amount people eat.
It also said that the same tax measures levied against sugary drinks appear to work with other sugary foods, as well as those high in saturated fats, trans fats, and salt.

There is seemingly little evidence to actually back this up. Can someone with relevant experience or qualifications give me your opinion? 

Basically I need around 4000 calories per day and obtaining this from ""healthy whole food sources"" is just a ridiculous amount of food. Mass gainer shakes I find are over priced so I like to get a fair chunk of my calories from perhaps ""unhealthy"" sources.  When I think of deep fried chips, I think potatoes, vegetable oil and salt. Potatoes, I would consider I healthy without hesitation. A great source of potassium, magnesium and fibre which I already know my current diet could use more of. Also where I live, deep fried chips are cheaper than raw potatoes  so if you factor in convenience and cost it seems to work out better for students. If you want to claim they're too high in sodium, I can ask for less salt on my chips. I usually don't have much salt at all in my diet anyway, so chips might even help since sodium is still a necessary mineral. Which only leaves fat content. I still get my  healthy fats from milk, avocado and fish oils so how bad can (at a guess) 3 or 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil be per day? Last I checked it's a good source of omega 6 which is an essential fat. 

I'm not suggesting that deep fried chips should replace green vegetables fruits and lean meats but for me it just seems like a convenient source of cost effective calories , carbs, fibre and minerals that my body needs for recovery from my daily powerlifting training. 

Are they really that unhealthy? I just can't quite fully understand why.

My (also health conscious) roommate is really considerate and buys a good deal of our staple foods for us. We usually shop at our local Trader Joe's. I know some items are a hit or miss there so we try to be careful. I avoid artificial colors and preservatives and always check labels to the best of my ability.

For breakfast, I honestly skip it a good four days out of the week. I'm not a morning person, especially when I have class. When I do eat breakfast I go with an omelette using cage free/organic eggs, spinach, green olives, and feta cheese. Or I blend a couple of bananas with some organic chocolate soy milk and it makes a good, quick shake. I usually don't drink very much coffee these days, twice a week at most. 

For lunch I usually make sandwiches using bagel slims or wraps with some sort of whole wheat content. My staple sandwich has hummus spread, pepper jack cheese, spinach, avocado, and a fried vegetable masala burger on it. Or I make a peanut butter and jelly (with just pure fruit preserves, no HFCS) sandwich with whole wheat bread.

For dinners, whole wheat organic pasta is always easy to make and a favorite so I eat this every week with light tomato sauce or alfredo and added onion, peppers, or garlic. I also eat fresh or frozen fillets of salmon, basa, or some other white fish once a week. I don't pay much mind to if the fish is farmed or wild caught, mainly the price. For a side it's usually either white rice with soy sauce, buttered red potatoes, sauteed organic veggies like carrots or green beans, or spinach/romaine salad with some kind of minimally processed salad dressing. 

The only fast food I eat is Subway, which is once every three to four weeks. Here I order a veggie on wheat and load up with all the veggies. I also indulge in takeout Chinese lunch specials occasionally, trying my best to get something with tofu every time for protein. 

Another potentially bad habit is during the middle of the night I make boxed mac n' cheese, usually Annie's brand or something not as unhealthy as Kraft. 

I snack on liquorice quite often (Panda liquorice being my favorite) and ice cream occasionally (just plain vanilla). I do drink pop, only with cane sugar or stevia as ingredients. Other than that it's juices like lemonade, pomegranate, cranberry, or some other juice blend that is at least 50% juice. 

I do take a multi vitamin supplement in a vegetable base just to make sure I'm making up for what I might be missing.

It was written and directed by Stephanie Soechtig, whose earlier films attacked GMO foods and the bottled water industry, and narrated by Katie Couric, who “gave anti-vaccine ideas a shot” on her talk show in late 2013.

The film shows families struggling with childhood obesity and “experts” expressing their opinions. Their selection of “experts” is heavy on politicians and journalists and light on nutrition scientists.

Is Sugar Really the Cause of the Obesity Epidemic?

Between 1971 and 2000, the prevalence of obesity in the United States doubled. During that time, fat consumption decreased, carbohydrate consumption rose, and average calorie intake rose (from 2450 to 2618 for men, and from 1542 to 1877 for women); the film blames sugar, but one could argue that total calorie intake was to blame.

Correlation is not causation, even when there is a strong correlation like the one between the rise in autism diagnoses and the rise in the sales of organic food. There is no such strong correlation between sugar consumption and obesity, much less any convincing evidence of causation.

Sugar consumption has actually decreased around the world even as the rate of obesity has continued to climb. Between 1999 and 2008, American consumption of added sugars decreased from 100 g/d to 76 g/d, mainly due to a reduction in soda consumption.

This webpage lists per capita sugar consumption by country, and it clearly does not correlate with rates of obesity in those countries. Countries with higher per capita sugar consumption than the US include Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Iceland, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, UK, and Venezuela. According to this source there are 17 countries with higher rates of obesity than the US. Not a single one of those countries has a higher per capita sugar consumption than the US.

There are other sources with different numbers, and these statistics don’t tell us much, because there are so many possible confounders such as lifestyle, total calorie intake, fiber, the type of sugar, hidden sugar in prepared foods, consumption of an otherwise nutritious diet, etc. The point is that it’s premature to make the kind of definitive pronouncements that the film makes about the role of sugar.

Gary Taubes makes a strong case for low-carb diets both for weight loss and health, but he admits that his hypothesis has not yet been properly tested. Chris Voight did an informal test of its exact opposite, a carbs-only diet: he ate nothing but potatoes for 60 days. According to Taubes’ low-carb theories he should have gained weight and raised his blood sugar, but instead he lost 21 pounds and lowered his blood sugar. His cholesterol and triglyceride levels dropped; he felt well and had plenty of energy.

The sugar/obesity hypothesis has not been properly tested either. There are plenty of examples of people who eat a lot of sugar and processed foods and don’t gain weight. In fact, one obese boy in the film complains that his brother eats the same way he does but doesn’t gain weight. There are plenty of examples of people who have lost weight and kept it off by reducing calorie intake and increasing exercise. We know some of the factors involved in successful weight loss, and eliminating sugar is not on the list.

Restaurants contribute to obesity by providing high-calorie food choices, large servings, and super-sized drinks. Fast food restaurants get a lot of blame, but John Cisna lost 56 pounds in 6 months while eating all his meals at McDonald’s. He counted calories and stuck to a 2000 calorie a day limit.

We don’t know that eliminating sugar from the diet is an effective strategy by itself. A family in the film eliminated sugar from their diet (they said they were “detoxing”!) and lost weight, but that could have been because they ate fewer total calories, and we don’t know that they would have lost any less weight if those fewer calories had included some calories from sugar. And the teenage boy lost weight but then gained it right back. What went wrong?

Colin Campbell of the Center for Nutritional Studies points out that the evidence showing sugar to be a major factor in obesity is relatively weak and is confounded by total calorie intake and other factors. He says:

    I know of no evidence that were we to eliminate all sugar from our diets, presumably leaving the rest of the diet the same, we could rid ourselves of disease and restore our health.

The Film Gets a Lot of Things Wrong

I was going to do some further fact checking, but Google saved me the trouble. I discovered that two writers at Food Insight had already analyzed the claims in Fed Up and shown that the filmmakers got many of their facts wrong. They give these examples:

    “This year for the first time in the history of the world, more people will die from the effects of obesity than from starvation.” Not true: three times as many die of starvation.
    “For the first time in 200 years, the current generation of children are expected to live shorter lives than their parents.” Expected by whom? According to the CDC and the Census Bureau, life expectancies are on an uninterrupted upward trajectory that is expected to continue rising until at least 2020.
    While fitness club memberships more than doubled, the obesity rate also doubled. A meaningless comparison that is intended to suggest that we are helpless to do anything about our weight.
    It rejects the concept of energy balance, but the scientific evidence clearly shows that it is possible to lose weight by decreasing calorie intake and increasing calorie expenditure.
    Dr. Robert Lustig gets a lot of screen time. He says that there is “really good data” that “a calorie is not a calorie,” in that the “toxicity” of sugars is an inherent and unique contributor to obesogenicity. “When your liver gets that big sugar rush… it has no choice but to turn it into fat immediately.” His language is inflammatory, demonizing sugar as toxic and addictive. Lustig’s views are inconsistent with mainstream scientific opinions based on all the available evidence. Dr. David Katz of the Yale Prevention Research Center characterizes Lustig’s theories as “humbug” and explains why.
    “Between 1977 and 2000, Americans have doubled their daily intake of sugar.” Not true: Americans are eating more total calories but have not doubled the calories from sugar.
    “Over 95 percent of all Americans will be overweight or obese in two decades.” No, obesity prevalence has leveled off since 2003 and the forecasted trend-line is virtually flat.
    It claims that consuming a single soda per day increases one’s risk of diabetes by 22 percent. Sugar doesn’t cause diabetes; the film presents a simplistic caricature of the relationship between sugar and diabetes.
    The film says the pledge of food companies to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the marketplace amounts to “nothing,” a mere 14 calories a day per person. Actually, they have already removed 6.4 trillion calories, ahead of schedule and more than 400 percent of the original goal. The resulting reduction of 78 calories a day per person is probably more than enough to meet the Healthy People 2020 target for obesity reduction.

This review concludes by saying the central claims of the film are shadings of the truth, sins of omission, and outright fabrication. It says the film’s “obsessive focus on a single nutrient actually could cause more harm than good, in that overconsumption of any macronutrient can lead to overweight and obesity.” It offers credible evidence and provides links to additional resources.

At Reason.com, Baylen Linnekin points out that the film overwhelmingly features supporters of increased food regulation, and non-supporters are treated unfairly. David Allison is asked for his opinion on the contribution of sugar sweetened beverages to obesity, and when he asks for a moment to collect his thoughts, the editing cuts him off and makes him look foolish.

In the film, Senator Tom Harkin asks how the food industry executives can sleep at night. I find that ironic. He supported farm bills that pay billions of dollars in subsidies to farmers in his home state Iowa, which leads the nation in high fructose corn syrup production. Harkin is a major advocate of alternative medicine who has been instrumental in legislation such as creating the NCCAM, a travesty and a waste of taxpayer dollars. He is so ignorant of how science works that he complained that the NCCAM has been disproving things rather than doing its intended job of “seeking out and approving.” He has been characterized on this blog as “waging a war on science.” I wonder how Harkin can sleep at night.
What Can Be Done to Improve the American Diet?

I think we can all agree that the typical American diet is not healthy. It provides too much processed food, convenience food, sodas, red meat, salt, sugars, and calories; and it is deficient in fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Sugar is only one part of the obesity problem, a part that may be due to its contribution to total calorie intake rather than anything inherently bad about sugar. No one would argue that we shouldn’t try to reduce sugar consumption; the question is how to accomplish that.

The film’s comparison to tobacco is interesting. For a long time, the tobacco industry misled the pubic about the dangers of smoking. Tobacco advertising dropped when equal time was required for anti-smoking information. Societal attitudes changed rapidly for tobacco thanks to public information campaigns. Legislation has contributed to a decrease in smoking, but I would argue that legislation would not have been possible without a change in public perceptions.

I think the general public is well aware of the need to control weight, and instead of trying to control their eating habits by passing laws to control the food industry, we might do better to educate them about how to eat a healthier diet. There is so much they don’t understand. The film shows tearful families unable to lose weight and trying so hard — but their efforts include things like switching from regular Hot Pockets to a low-fat version. There are many flavors of Lean Pockets, but the very first one I looked up contained the equivalent of 3-4 tsp of sugar and a whopping 655 calories. Obese teenagers are shown lamenting their inability to lose weight while gorging on cereal, finishing large bags of potato chips to “savor the flavor,” and choosing hamburgers and fries for lunch at school. One is shown making what he thinks is a “healthy lunch” to take to school: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich! These people desperately want to adopt healthier eating habits, but they have no idea how to go about it. How can we best help them?

People complain that they weren’t able to lose weight by reducing calories, but some of them don’t realize that they never actually reduced calories enough to get results. I once had an overweight 13-year-old boy as a patient. I asked what he usually ate for lunch, and we calculated that his daily cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake added up to over 1000 calories. I asked if he would consider bringing a lower calorie sack lunch from home, and he enthusiastically agreed. He had never even thought of that option. I had an adult patient who couldn’t understand why she hadn’t lost weight when she was eating mostly yogurt. She thought yogurt was “diet food” so she could eat as much of it as she wanted. When I asked her to read the label, she was astounded to learn that each container of yogurt had 240 calories.

Efforts are already underway to improve school lunches and remove junk food vending machines from schools. That’s a step in the right direction. Agatha Raisin, a character in a delicious series of mystery novels by M. C. Beaton, brags that she loves to cook, but her idea of cooking is sticking a TV dinner in the microwave. A lot of our young people grow up with similar ideas about what it means to cook. Why not require Home Ec classes in our schools? They could teach nutrition, menu planning, and meal preparation from scratch with fresh ingredients. Students might learn to think of healthier options when it comes to planning what to do for dinner.

To my mind, it’s not just a matter of educating children, but of educating the parents who buy and serve the food their children eat at home, educating the parents who think you can lose weight by switching from Hot Pockets to Lean Pockets. Just as information campaigns educated the public about smoking, they could educate the public about healthy food choices, hidden sugars, and calorie content of various foods. Even without legislation, a public outcry and grass roots movements would be enough to change food manufacturing. The food industry exists to please its customers and has provided us with easy, timesaving, attractive options that are hard to resist. What if the general public learned to buy less processed food, to read labels, to avoid hidden sugars, to be aware of how many calories they are ingesting, and to enjoy cooking at home. If they did that, market forces would make the food industry adapt. If companies wanted to keep profits up, they would have to be creative about providing healthier products. Just think how quickly they responded to public enthusiasms like gluten-free and low-carb.

People naturally tend to eat the way their parents ate, the way their culture eats. It can be hard for them to even imagine other ways of eating. My parents grew up on farms and ate the way their own parents and grandparents had always eaten. I grew up thinking the ideal meal was meat, potatoes, a green vegetable, a yellow vegetable, bread and butter, a sugary dessert, and milk for a beverage. Last night I cooked dinner from scratch, using several ingredients that never crossed the threshold of my mother’s kitchen, including red quinoa, chickpeas, collard greens, olive oil, yogurt, and limes. I used to see items like those in the grocery store and pass them by; it never would have occurred to me to cook with them because I had no experience with them and wouldn’t have known what to do with them. We can’t expect people to think outside the box of the traditional American family dinner table and the fast food restaurant without some help. My horizons have been hugely expanded by subscribing to the Blue Apron program, which has me cooking from scratch with a variety of ingredients like heirloom vegetables and exotic foods from other cultures (many of which I had never even heard of) and trying out new cooking techniques. Blue Apron is expensive and is not something that could be recommended for everyone, but I can see how school programs and media campaigns might be able to accomplish something similar.

I favor education over regulation. I’m not against regulating the food industry, but I would like to see proposals tested before they are widely implemented. Providing nutrition information on menus seemed like a great idea, but it has had minimal impact on food choices in real-world settings. Many thousands of young people were put through abstinence-only sex education programs before we realized they were ineffective and might even be doing more harm than good. We can’t just assume that any proposed remedy for the obesity epidemic will work. No matter how slam-dunk it sounds, it must be tested using scientific methods.
Conclusion

The film’s thesis, that sugar has caused the obesity epidemic, is not well supported by evidence. It is a partial truth that the filmmakers have dogmatically represented as the whole truth, with nary a hint of nuance. And it’s not fair to demonize the food industry. It has done a lot of good by providing a greater variety of safer food to more people for lower prices. We must share the responsibility for their shortcomings, because their less healthy offerings were created in response to public demand, and large numbers of people have chosen to buy those products because they don’t know any better.

The film will undoubtedly do some good by helping raise public awareness of childhood obesity and of hidden sugars in processed foods. I only wish it could have done so without misrepresenting the facts and without the bias and hype in support of the filmmakers’ political agenda of increasing food regulation. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I enjoy an occasional sugary treat and fast food meal, and I appreciate the convenience of packaged, processed foods when I don’t have a lot of time to shop and cook. I see no compelling reason to think it is impossible for people to lose weight on a diet that is overall nutritious and calorie controlled but that allows small amounts of even the “worst” foods.

Abstract  

**Objective:**  
  
Menopause represents a period in which bone deterioration is accelerated; thus, primary prevention strategies to address age-related bone loss are crucial. Dairy products contain more than a dozen essential nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and high-quality protein, as well as bioactive compounds that may promote bone mineralization. However, the relationship between dairy consumption and bone health across the menopause transition remains largely unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the change in lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density and the risk of bone fracture by the frequency of dairy intakes among women across the menopausal transition using the publicly available data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation.  
  
**Methods:**  
  
We analyzed total dairy foods in four categories of &lt;0.5, 0.5 to &lt;1.5, 1.5 to &lt;2.5, and ≥2.5servings/d or &lt;1.5 and ≥1.5servings/d. A general linear model was used to estimate the association of dairy intake with the 10-year bone mineral density loss rate and a linear mixed model was used to estimate the annualized bone mineral density loss rate of the femoral neck and lumbar spine. A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the nontraumatic fractures. Poisson regression was used to determine the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of the nontraumatic fractures. The models were controlled for race/ethnicity, age, height, weight, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, calcium use, menopausal status, and total caloric intake.  
  
**Results:**  
  
No significant differences in bone mineral density change were observed, regardless of baseline menopausal status. No significant differences in the risk of nontraumatic fracture were observed.  
  
**Conclusions:**  
  
In this group of US women undergoing the menopausal transition, dairy food intake was neither associated with femoral and spine bone mineral density loss nor the risk of fractures.",2020-06-06,

Evidence-based dietary pattern guidance to promote cardiometabolic health includes the following: (1) adjust energy intake and expenditure to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight; (2) eat plenty and a variety of fruits and vegetables; (3) choose whole grain foods and products; (4) choose healthy sources of protein (mostly plants; regular intake of fish and seafood; low-fat or fat-free dairy products; and if meat or poultry is desired, choose lean cuts and unprocessed forms); (5) use liquid plant oils rather than tropical oils and partially hydrogenated fats; (6) choose minimally processed foods instead of ultra-processed foods; (7) minimize the intake of beverages and foods with added sugars; (8) choose and prepare foods with little or no salt; (9) if you do not drink alcohol, do not start; if you choose to drink alcohol, limit intake; and (10) adhere to this guidance regardless of where food is prepared or consumed. Challenges that impede adherence to heart-healthy dietary patterns include targeted marketing of unhealthy foods, neighborhood segregation, food and nutrition insecurity, and structural racism. Creating an environment that facilitates, rather than impedes, adherence to heart-healthy dietary patterns among all individuals is a public health imperative.

Also, for the curious, note the comments on keto and intermittent fasting on CVD which is frequently discussed on this sub:

Some heart-healthy dietary patterns emphasized in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans include the Mediterranean style, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style, Healthy US-Style, and healthy vegetarian diets.5 Research on dietary patterns that used data from 3 large cohorts of US adults, the Dietary Patterns Methods Project, found a 14% to 28% lower CVD mortality among adults with high compared with low adherence to high-quality dietary patterns.6 However, most research on dietary patterns has been conducted in Western populations; future dietary guidance would benefit from research in non-Western countries. *There is insufficient evidence to support any existing popular or fad diets such as the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting to promote heart health.* 7,8

“ ABSTRACT

Background

In previous meta-analyses of prospective observational studies, we investigated the association between food groups and risk of chronic disease.

Objective

The aim of the present network meta-analysis (NMA) was to assess the effects of these food groups on intermediate-disease markers across randomized intervention trials.

Design

Literature searches were performed until January 2018. The following inclusion criteria were defined a priori: 1) randomized trial (≥4 wk duration) comparing ≥2 of the following food groups: refined grains, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits and vegetables, eggs, dairy, fish, red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs); 2) LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol (TG) were defined as primary outcomes; total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and C-reactive protein were defined as secondary outcomes. For each outcome, a random NMA was performed, and for the ranking, the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) was determined.

Results

A total of 66 randomized trials (86 reports) comparing 10 food groups and enrolling 3595 participants was identified. Nuts were ranked as the best food group at reducing LDL cholesterol (SUCRA: 93%), followed by legumes (85%) and whole grains (70%). For reducing TG, fish (97%) was ranked best, followed by nuts (78%) and red meat (72%). However, these findings are limited by the low quality of the evidence. When combining all 10 outcomes, the highest SUCRA values were found for nuts (66%), legumes (62%), and whole grains (62%), whereas SSBs performed worst (29%).

Conclusion

**The present NMA provides evidence that increased intake of nuts, legumes, and whole grains is more effective at improving metabolic health than other food groups**. For the credibility of diet-disease relations, high-quality randomized trials focusing on well-established intermediate-disease markers could play an important role. “

dairy AND quality,2yvw3p,Is yogurt good for you?,nutrition,51,0.82,"Yogurt may be one of the first foods you think of when you think “diet.” It contains lots of nutrients, helps improve gut flora and more. Just like any food, though, eating low-quality yogurt can actually be unhealthy. From Greek and probiotic to frozen and high sugar, yogurt is available in forms both good for you and not so much.

What is yogurt exactly?

Basically, yogurt is the result of adding harmless bacteria to milk and letting it sit for a while. The bacteria begin to process various parts of the milk, changing the texture and taste.

Differences in yogurt types start right at the beginning, as some yogurts use whole milk, some low-fat milk, and the types of bacteria added can vary. You can even boil off some of the water in the milk first, then strain it, like Greek yogurt.

The many means of preparation can result in differences in the content of yogurt as well. Greek yogurt is generally higher in protein and fat while lower in sugar, making it possibly the healthiest yogurt and the best type of yogurt to use as an appetite suppressant.

It’s important to stay aware of the gradient of healthy to not-healthy yogurts out there. Flavored yogurts and cheaper varieties often have a lot of added sugar. This is sometimes the case with low-fat yogurts too. If you’re eating yogurt with a lot of sugar (or piling on unhealthy toppings), you can hurt your Insulin Efficiency the same way that you would eating candy.

Some yogurts may be sugar free, meaning the sugar is replaced with artificial sweeteners. Unfortunately, fake sugar has its own set of problems.

The best thing to do is simply read the Nutrition Facts on the back of yogurt before buying.

The benefits of yogurt:

Many studies have been done on the health benefits of yogurt. One, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that yogurt improved gastrointestinal function in subjects, meaning it could help prevent many digestive problems, such as “lactose intolerance, constipation, diarrheal diseases, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease” and more. People with a high intake of yogurt are also less likely to develop diabetes.

Yogurt, like most dairy products, is a good source of calcium, which helps build stronger bones and prevent osteoporosis. Yogurt also contains:

Vitamin A: Important for your eyes
Vitamin E: Improves immune system and a natural antioxidant
Bacteria: Improve health of gut flora
Linoleic acid: Boosts immune system and acts as an anticarcinogen
Protein: A wide range of benefits, including weight loss and muscle health.
Iodine: Helps improve your metabolic rate, i.e., you use energy more quickly and efficiently.
And more!

Again, it’s important to know what variety of yogurt you’re getting. Greek has the most protein, while yogurt from whole milk will have more vitamin A and E. Also, you can often find dairy products fortified with vitamin D, an important vitamin to make sure you get enough of.

The bacteria added to milk to form yogurt are perhaps the most important ingredient and play a major role in the benefits of yogurt to your digestive system. It’s also where the terms prebiotic and probiotic come into play. Some foods, like apples, can be prebiotic, meaning they contain nutrients beneficial to the gut bacteria living naturally in our digestive tract.

Others are probiotic, meaning the living bacteria is actually in the food, thereby increasing the good bacteria, or gut flora, in our bodies.

Not all yogurts are probiotic. If you are interested in probiotic benefits, be sure to always look for “live and active cultures” on the label before buying.

So, is yogurt good for you? Yes, with some minor caveats: avoid added sugars and be careful what toppings you put on top. Berries are an easy and healthy addition to yogurt, as are whole grains, flaxseed and many others.",2015-03-13,

Protein

Protein is an essential nutrient (like fat and carbohydrate) your body needs each day to help build and maintain muscle mass. Nevertheless, not all proteins are created equal—quality make a difference.  High quality protein foods make it easy for you to get all of the essential amino acids your body needs to build and maintain muscle and help your body work properly.  Among protein sources, whey protein is an easily digested, rapidly absorbed high quality protein that is usually found in dairy.
Numerous scientific studies shows that whey protein helps promote muscle repair and recovery after exercise.  Also a diet high in protein can:
maintain a healthy weight
curb hunger
build lean muscle
enhance exercise recovery
maintain muscle mass as you age
3 Steps to choosing protein:

Quality: Not all proteins are equal for muscle protein synthesis.  Whey protein is a high quality protein protein containing all of the Essential Amino Acids and high levels of Branch Chain Amino Acids.

Versatility: Whey protein can be easily added to a variety of foods and recipes.

Stir into hot foods like soups, past sauces and stews
Use as an ingredient in baked goods
Include in dips or stir into hot cereal or creamy sauces
Add to peanut or other nut butters
Timing: Add high quality whey protein to meals and snacks to help boost protein intake.

Breakfast

Berry Smoothie
Nonfat Greek yogurt
frozen berries
banana, ice + 3tsp vanilla whey protein
Lunch

Tomato soup + 2tbsp whey protein powder

**Results**

&gt;We found exceptionally strong relationships between some of the examined factors, the highest being a correlation between raised cholesterol in men and the combined consumption of animal fat and animal protein (r=0.92, p&lt;0.001). The most significant dietary correlate of low CVD risk was high total fat and animal protein consumption. Additional statistical analyses further highlighted citrus fruits, high-fat dairy (cheese) and tree nuts. Among other non-dietary factors, health expenditure showed by far the highest correlation coefficients. The major correlate of high CVD risk was the proportion of energy from carbohydrates and alcohol, or from potato and cereal carbohydrates. Similar patterns were observed between food consumption and CVD statistics from the period 1980–2000, which shows that these relationships are stable over time. However, we found striking discrepancies in men's CVD statistics from 1980 and 1990, which can probably explain the origin of the ‘saturated fat hypothesis’ that influenced public health policies in the following decades.

**Conclusion**

&gt;Our results do not support the association between CVDs and saturated fat, which is still contained in official dietary guidelines. Instead, they agree with data accumulated from recent studies that link CVD risk with the high glycaemic index/load of carbohydrate-based diets. In the absence of any scientific evidence connecting saturated fat with CVDs, these findings show that current dietary recommendations regarding CVDs should be seriously reconsidered.

Some notes:

* Remarkably, the relationship of raised cholesterol with CVD risk is always negative, especially in the case of total CVD mortality (r=−0.69 in men, r=−0.71 in women; p&lt;0.001)

* The most consistent relationship with CVD risk can be found in cereals, especially with raised blood glucose (r=0.44, p=0.004 in men; r=0.70, p&lt;0.001 in women) and with total CVD mortality (r=0.54 in men, r=0.61 in women, p&lt;0.001).

* Both this study and other studies dealing with blood profiles of patients hospitalised with CVD events (18–22) demonstrate that low HDL (high-density lipoprotein associated) cholesterol (around ~1.0 mmol/L), or high total cholesterol: HDL-cholesterol ratio are the best indicators of CVD risk. Total cholesterol is usually normal or slightly elevated (4.5–5.5 mmol/L), and hence it cannot serve as a predictor of CVD events. 

* There is also no evidence that the reduction of saturated fat intake (on its own) would decrease CVD risk (28). On the other hand, it is true, that so far, there is no clear evidence that saturated fat would be beneficial for the prevention of CVD. 

* The results of our study show that high-glycaemic carbohydrates or a high overall proportion of carbohydrates in the diet are the key ecological correlates of CVD risk. These findings strikingly contradict the traditional ‘saturated fat hypothesis’, but in reality, they are compatible with the evidence accumulated from observational studies that points to both high glycaemic index and high glycaemic load (the amount of consumed carbohydrates × their glycaemic index) as important triggers of CVDs

* Refined sugar is also positively tied to many animal products such as animal fat (r=0.57; p&lt;0.001) and total fat and animal protein (r=0.52; p&lt;0.001), and negatively to % PC CARB energy (r=−0.58; p&lt;0.001) and % CA energy (r=−0.47; p=0.001).

* In fact, the proportion of CA energy (carbohydrates and alcohol) correlates more strongly with CVD risk than the proportion of energy from carbohydrates alone, alcoholic beverages excluded...alcoholic beverages correlate most negatively with % PC CARB energy (r=−0.68, p&lt;0.001) and most positively with meat, particularly pork (both r=0.76, p&lt;0.001).

* Our finding that total fat and animal protein (or total fat and total protein) is the strongest correlate of low CVD risk is again in accordance with the hypothesis linking CVD risk to postprandial hyperglycaemia because a high consumption of fat and protein indicates a low dietary glycaemic load.

* This conclusion is complicated by the strong collinearity between meat and alcoholic beverages (r=0.76, p&lt;0.001), which usually applies even at the individual level and it may effectively blur any health role of these two food items

* Both fruits (as a whole) and wine do not figure among the consistent correlates of CVD 

* Vegetables... did not figure among the negative correlates of CVD risk... vegetables have a basically curvilinear relationship to CVD risk, and they may work as a sort of prevention only when very high amounts (&gt;300 g/day) are consumed  and especially when they substitute cereal and potato carbohydrates

* Health expenditure (both for 2008 and 1995–2008) is the most negative correlate of total CVD mortality in both sexes and health expenditure for 1995–2008 is even the strongest negative correlate of raised blood pressure. It is also the main confounding factor in the whole study. 

* The positive effect of low-carbohydrate diets on CVD risk factors (obesity, blood lipids, blood glucose, insulin, blood pressure) is already apparent in short-term clinical trials lasting 3–36 months (58) and low-carbohydrate diets also appear superior to low-fat diets in this regard (36, 37). However, these findings are still not reflected by official dietary recommendations that continue to perpetuate the unproven connection between saturated fat and CVDs

* In sharp contrast to CVDs, cancer correlates with the consumption of animal food (particularly animal fat), alcohol, a high dietary protein quality, high cholesterol levels, high health expenditure, and above average height.

* Considering the unreliability of observational studies highlighting low-fat dairy and the existence of strong bias regarding the intake of saturated fat, the health effect of various dairy products should be carefully tested in controlled clinical studies. 

* A very important case is that of cereals because whole grain cereals are often propagated as CVD prevention. It is true that whole grain cereals are usually characterised by lower GI and FII values than refined cereals, and their benefits have been documented in numerous observational studies (63), but their consumption is also tied with a healthy lifestyle. All the available clinical trials have been of short duration and have produced inconsistent results indicating that the possible benefits are related to the substitution of refined cereals for whole grain cereals, and not because of whole grain cereals per se

When I became a vegan, it was also when I became increasingly aware of my nutrition. I never ate extremely unhealthily, and while I was maybe a bit heavier than I should've been, it was when I was young (I became vegan when I was 17 years old, so I'm not sure if my weight fluctuations during my middle- and high-school years were due to my diet or normal weight fluctuations during growth). After I went vegan, I lost some weight, and my weight has varied within ten pounds since I've gone vegan.

Again, the quality of the food I have been eating has definitely improved since I've gone vegan, but how I feel has not. I often feel hungry, even right after a meal I usually do not feel satisfied. Also, I get tired pretty early in the day, despite usually getting about 7.5 hours of sleep a night. I also often feel a lack of energy and lethargy, and get cold easily. I'm only 19 years old--I shouldn't feel like this.

I am an avid runner, running 4-6 miles a day, though I do still worry about the quantity of food I am eating, as I am small (5') and do not want to gain weight.

I am trying to limit gluten in my diet, as I have a cousin with Celiac, and believe I may have a sensitivity as well. I mainly stick to oatmeal, plenty of vegetables, some fruits, potatoes, beans, chickpeas, tofu, and tempeh.

It's also hard for me to eat healthy, much less vegan, because for the next four months I'm living in a dorm, so I'm limited to my school's dining hall or the microwave in my room. My school has a salad bar which is pretty decent, and stir fry, but strangely enough, the specifically vegan meals they prepare are starch-heavy and light on the vegetables, with terrible portions. 

Even if I did eat meat/animal products, I would be just as limited because everything else here is not great for you--sandwiches, burgers, pizza, pasta, etc. And the meat/eggs are definitely not organic/grass-fed/etc. anyway, though I'm pretty hesitant to go back to eating animal products, but I'm wondering if perhaps a vegan diet just isn't for me. I was a pescatarian for a few years before I went vegan, and ate a lot of cheese and eggs. I definitely do not miss dairy, though, but am wondering if perhaps at the moment I don't get enough protein or fat.

Has anyone struggled with similar issues? I don't like feeling hungry all the time, and while I don't want to go back to eating meat and eggs, I do remember never feeling like this while I ate it. My dietician always told me to eat more whole grains, but I don't think that's the solution. Can anyone help me out or give me some advice?

I might feel tired and not like doing things, but once I get going, I'm OK. With whatever's going on now, I feel too tired to stand up sometimes, I feel physically weak. Climbing stairs is like climbing a mountain (I was running up the same stairs last year!). If I push myself like I do with depression I get a backlash the next day.

In the past I felt similarly hungry and constantly craved ice cream so I took a cal mag supplement and the hunger went away and the weight dropped off. I figured when I removed dairy from my diet I wasn't getting enough calcium. Cal mag supplement didn't work this time. I might be missing more than that...


Right now my resources are limited: I'm unemployed, was homeless for a while (and subsisted on fast food for a while) and am currently on SNAP and Medicaid. This basically means I'm pretty much on my own to figure it out. Medicaid is a joke, I hope nothing happens to me where I actually need medical care. There are wait lists and doctors (well I've never seen a doctor, you see a resident who leaves the room to consult a doc if one is available to answer her question) don't want to spend money on tests, they find loopholes to avoid helping you where they can. This situation is maddening. I'm not sure what tests I would ask for if I could get the do do them (and if they were covered by medicaid).

I used to be pretty lucky to live in an area that was relatively unpolluted and had a strong local farming community. I could buy organic, local fresh vibrant produce and grassfed meat, or get them from friends and neighbors. I cooked every day. I ate a mostly Paleo diet. biked, hiked, had lots of energy. I've moved cities and the produce here just tastes like crap. I used to love vegetables, now I'm trying to force them down, but I'm not sure how I can make sure I'm eating enough nutrients. Everyone here looks so much older. The pollution and food quality must affect them. 

I have access to a kitchen, I'm pretty exhausted most days and standing up can be an effort, so I need to find things that are easy till I get my energy back. I have food intolerances to wheat, dairy and eggs (they make me tired, give me diahrrea and brain foggy, unable to concentrate). I admit I haven't been avoiding these foods as much as I normally would because of the expense and effort. And plus I'm not sure what would keep well for the hours I'm out during the day. I seem to also have a problem with coconut milk and peanut butter.  There may be other intolerances I haven't figured out. I don't do well with grains. I'm female, forties.

How would I best make sure I'm getting enough nutrients? Is there a good budget supplement that I could take that might work? Are there resources you recommend? Anything I should test for (am on medicaid)?

You only use a little bit of it each time you make a batch of Fil milk, so the package will last for a long time. Freeze the excess divided into small air tight packages, then you have new starter if you end up needing it. You can use any pasteurized milk you want, but it will be best with a fatter variant (eg standard 4% fat milk).

Heat the regular milk first. Heat until it is almost boiling. You should see small bubbles in the saucepan, but it should not boil. The heating will kill all unwanted bacteria so that the good bacteria can get the upper hand. If you use pasteurized buttermilk and clean tools, you can skip step this step.

MIX IN THE YMP - Let the milk to cool to room temperature. Then mix in a little starter fil milk/YMP. Some tablespoons of it per liter of milk are usually good.

LET IT REST - Let the mixture stand at room temperature overnight (or until it is ready).

STORE COLD - Keep it in the refrigerator when it is ready, otherwise it will continue to ferment and become alcoholic. Totally worth it though but kinda tricky to get the right alcoholic content. If the ready-made ""fil"" milk tastes or smells bad then you should not eat it. In that case, it will be bad and you will have to throw it out and restart with a fresh batch.

SAVE SMALL BATCHES - Once you have eaten almost the entire film milk, you save only one slice that you use as grafting on the next rate (instead of using bacon milk). You can continue to grab the last sludge for any length of time, so you do not have to start over again with buying new ""Fil"" milk/YMP.


----------------------------------

It actually started out as a traditional dish where farmers would keep a starter like some bakers would keep sourdough starters. Then they shared the starters with eachother for taste and to replace a batch thats gone bad.

Ymp is just a swedish name for the piece of the ""Fil"" milk that you save to make new Fil milk with.

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars. I can dig it up or get some email/phone numbers for you if youre interested.

You can always email the verum folks over here if youre interested in more recipies or starter packs or whatever else: forum@norrmejerier.se

Theres more contact info over here: https://verum.se/kontakt/

If you want to try this then I think A-fil and Långfil are the easiest to do it with. Verum Hälsofil can be done but it contains so many millions of bacteria per dl that it tend to grow rather quickly so you need to keep a closer eye on it.

For the sake of not introducing bad bacteria I would stick to using small frozen packets of the initial Fil milk. Make sure they are air tight and has as little air in the bag as possible. Then put the bags collected in an airtight container.

If nothing else you'll have an interesting special dish to take out when you're hungover or got visitors.

I personally enjoy putting a bit of salt in it and ice cubes during the summer with a little splash of wayer. Then I drink it with a straw like the turkish Ayran yoghurtdrink.

Its a bit unusual and I have not seen much discussion on the topic elswehere on the site. So I'm curious to hear what you think of the nutrition qualities of this type of fermented dairy?

""Why am I lethargic, tired, weak, easily agitated, hostile, not calm?""  or ""How do i grow to be the best I can be? How can I provide the most for my genetics and body?  Stand outside in the sun for hours straight and you will change, you will mutate.  Nutrition is the same.  Everything is a stimuli.  

I've experimented with all kinds of diets at this point.  One meal a day, vegan (1 month), low carb, high caloric intake, caloric deficits, and I'm currently 90% plant 10% animal (high quality meat once a week) 0% dairy

my journey in learning nutrition breaks down to about 2 phases:
fundamental truths (1) and absorption/special interests (2)

Phase 1: Fundamentals.  Pick up that PhD Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism book and understand maybe 10% of it.  Go to Google and cross-reference everyday for months. Build redundancy.  Build Facts.  Vitamin D will always be Vitamin D.  A protein does this.  A carbohydrate does that.  Fats insulate the brain, help with hormonal regulation, ble ble ble.

Phase 2: Absorption, Specific interests and concerns

Am I just pissing out money? My vitamin d3 pills work. I'm military  and I can get that bloodwork easily.  Those one meal a day guys--&gt; I tried it, but you do know about nutritional inhibitors and nutritional synergies right?   Could do a targeted nutrition 1 meal a day like a calcium day and an iron day (quickly pulled stuff out of my mind)

While I was reading several chapters from that PhD book mentioned above, i realized that I wasn't understanding most of it and most importantly it made me realize that while they've done the hard work, the 'general' advice from that hard work has been distributed to us already. Example: ""Eat whole, eat clean, avoid processed foods, avoid empty calories.""  What more can you do in this physical world than that?  I've been self sufficient such that I cook for myself, I work out, I feel great so in some sense there is a stopping point. Example: This broccoli that I prep and steam can only go so far from its physical state while attempting to maintain its nutritional profile.  As of now, other than putting things in your mouth your options to build and provide yourself are limited.  Supplementation(Oral/I.V.), Neurobics?, Exercise

So I've been listening to my body for so long, so consistently, that I've developed sort of a sixth-sense in being able to analyze a given macronutrient or any food product at the store and see how my body will make use of it.  Believe it or not, I really almost rid my self of any cravings for garbage food just because I know so well that it's not satiating and that it DOES cause problems #NewtonsLaw. When I just look at a bag of chips, I already know the before, present, and after. crashhhhhhhhh  I keep reaching higher and higher levels of understanding when I think I'm reaching a stopping limit.  I'm going to reach Zen status eventually, no damn joke.  Results? My unit is hailing me for my physical performance lmao and I tell you I'm a damn Nerd who goes to the Gym once a week. I've smoked cigarettes for 5 years, 3 years free now.  I enjoy junk foods once a week and It's almost becoming a chore to cheat once a week— You hear me?


this may have been eye-rolling for some people but a lot of posts on this reddit makes me eye-roll

dairy AND quality,6fya8p,Low on energy after weight loss,nutrition,3,0.76,"I've spent the last year trying to change my diet and lifestyle choices for the better, and I would love to hear suggestions on if there are any further changes I may benefit from.

I'm 34 and female.  A year ago, I was obese and sedentary with a major sugar addiction.  I was pre-hypertensive, borderline pre-diabetic, and had high triglycerides.  I have IBS and GERD and was continuing to eat trigger foods even though I knew better - I was pretty much in bed every night after dinner.  My quality of life was poor. 

Last year, a friend introduced me to the ketogenic diet which I did for 3 months.  I managed to lose 30 pounds and lost most of the sugar cravings.  I then switched to just a balanced calorie counting diet (1000-1400 calories a daily) and lost another 35ish pounds that way.  I've gone from 192 - 128 in a year (I'm 5'6"") which is a normal BMI, but I'm not sure it's a good weight.  People tell me that I look ""too thin"" and I've lost pretty much all fat from the top half of my body (which makes me look underweight) and store all of my fat in the stomach/thigh area.  I've got very little muscle, and most likely a higher body fat percentage.  I know that I would probably look better if I gained 10-15 pounds, but I worry about gaining more fat in my stomach area as I've heard that can be a health risk. 

I've been feeling just generally unwell with low energy and fatigue all the time.  I do try to exercise several times a week, but if my energy isn't there, I just skip it. I do alternate cardio and weight lifting (which I recently started).  I sleep 7 hours a night typically.I tend to eat pretty healthy, partly to avoid an IBS flare.  I can't do fried/greasy/fatty food or anything with tomato or citrus.  I can handle dairy products in small amounts.  I track everything I eat and usually somewhere between 1500-2200.  I'm not totally sure of my TDEE.  While I was still restricting calories, I was suddenly no longer able to function whatsoever so I bumped up my calories pretty quickly and my intake varies from day to day.  I'll also note that I've been trying to get in at least 100 grams of protein daily and I upped my fat intake.  I was only eating 10% fat and I'm now at 25-30% (which has helped some). 

I do have a doctor appointment with this week and I know my hemoglobin will be tested (I've had issues with it in the past) and other things as well.  My doctor sounded a little concerned in the amount of weight I've lost so she wants to do a full physical.  

This is what I ate yesterday as an example:
Breakfast: Oatmeal with 2T hazelnut butter and raspberries
3 cups of coffee with creamer and stevia (throughout the morning)

Lunch:4 oz chicken breast, brown rice, greek yogurt 

Dinner: Pulled pork on wheat bun, pita chips, zucchini

Snacks: 1/4 cup almonds, protein shake, another greek yogurt

I was recently asked many times what I did to lose around 30 pounds of weight while gaining muscle. Especially since people seem to start worrying again after the holiday feasts, I thought I could write down what a diet looks like that brings success. But also I would like to make people understand what our food is and how you need to make use of what we have available.

It is time to understand the ultimate super hero weapon. A tool so powerful it will be your radioactive spider, your Mjölnir, your gamma bomb explosion, your super soldier formula, your Adamantium skeleton, your…. you get the point. It will be the beginning of your new life, your new abilities and will also require your highest attention.

The way you eat. (aka your diet)

Why do I say it will require your highest attention? Because it’s super difficult, rocket science heavy stuff to learn? NO. It really isn’t. The answer is simple. It’s the most efficient and result delivering part of the equation for somebody who wants to get strong and lose weight. Even if your goal is neither of these, it is still extremely important to fuel your body the right way. So that you stay healthy and have a good life.

Let's start with the basics.

**What’s a diet?**

OK, let’s clarify very quickly what a diet is. And let’s not make it a discussion point. Let’s define it for the entire future of our journey together here at hero upgrade.

And let me start with what it is NOT. A diet is not a temporary thing. It is not a bunch of recipes you cook for 30 days and then go back to eat the way you did before. It is not a unsustainable “quick fix “that you suffer through in agony and pain and makes you miserable until that red mark on the calendar is reached to release you back into old habits.

A diet is first of all simply what and how you eat. If your decision is to eat cabbage soup for 60 days straight because a magazine promised you a six pack in return and then go back to drinking tons of coke, eating ice cream and deep fried stuff, then this is your diet.

But as you might imagine cycling cabbage soup and ice cream is not the diet I’m gonna recommend to you. The chances for that one to be successful is similar to hit a one shot into a football sized exhaust port and down the pipe of a moon-sized space station into its core. Not entirely impossible, but pretty unlikely unless you are a space wizard.

Now that we clarified what a diet is, let’s see how your’s should look.

 

**What our food consists of**

A meal can have a lot of ingredients, but that is not what is meant by what our food consists of. Everything that we eat or make our meals from contains different macronutrients. There are three major macronutrients: Fat, protein and carbohydrate. These are chemical compounds that provide us with energy. Let’s get a quick look at them.

 

**Protein**

Protein is very important to us. To us as humans because it serves the nine essential amino acids which the body must obtain from food in order to not die, and to us as super humans because we use protein to repair damaged muscle and bones. Plus it is believed to increase physical performance. Also maintaining muscles makes your body burn fat. It is one of the most metabolic macronutrients, meaning just by consuming proteins you already burn some calories.

Now you might say “Enough praising proteins already, Dom. We got it.” But there is more. Protein keeps you full for longer. This way you might not stuff food in your mouth all the time during the day. This will come in handy 

Eat more protein. Now I’m done.

 

**Fat**

Fat makes you fat. Avoid it. Right? Right?

WRONG!

You must have your DeLorean parking around the corner, but let me tell you what changed since you hopped in 1985.

While for many years fat was the bad boy in the kitchen and everybody thought they were doing their bodies a favor by buying yummy fat free products, we have a different picture today. Your body needs fat. Fat is very important to get your hormones work properly, is needed for your brain and essential for blood clotting, muscle movement, and inflammation.

That being said fat provides more energy density than carbs and protein. Meaning 1g of fat has 9kcal, while 1g or carbohydrates or protein each have 4kcal. This means you of course need to look a bit after your fat consumption since it adds quickly to your calorie intake. But cutting the fats out just to save calories is simply not the right way for the reasons stated above.

And back to fat-free products. These are loaded with sugar. There. I said it. Go check the food label if you don’t believe me. You’re welcome.

“Awesome.” you say. “Then I at least get to eat some more french fries with my Steak.”

Wait… Here is where you gonna start hate me. While I beg you to forget the fat ban and actually eat fat, I need to probably exclude most fatty foods that you like 

OK, OK, stay with me. It’s not so bad. We will have a lot of tasty options, so don’t throw in the towel.

“Come on man, this is getting complicated. Which fats are good and which are bad now?”

 

Alright, here is how it goes:

 

*The Good …*

Unsaturated fats are the fats you gonna be looking for. All fats contain a mix of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Looking for foods which contain more unsaturated fat and less saturated fat is the goal. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats help to maintain healthy cholesterol levels and polyunsaturated fats contain important fatty acids like omega-3 which are crucial for a healthy body.

There are two main types of polyunsaturated fats: omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Both types offer health benefits.

Examples of foods high in omega-3 fatty acids: 

* fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, trout and sardines
* flaxseeds
* walnuts
* canola oil
* unhydrogenated soybean oil.

Examples of foods high in omega-6 fatty acids:

* safflower oil
* sunflower oil
* walnut oil
* corn oil

Examples of foods high in monounsaturated fats:

* olive oil
* canola oil
* peanut oil
* safflower oil
* sesame oil
* avocado
 

*… the Bad …*

Saturated fats are the ones to watch out a little bit and cut back if possible. They are suspected to lead to heart diseases and narrowed arteries.

These foods contain saturated fats

* butter and lard
* fatty meats
* cream, sour cream and ice cream
* hard cheese
* palm oil
* biscuits and cakes
* coconut oil
* full fat milk

A quick word on full fat milk and coconut oil. I have both. Pretty often. I prefer good virgin coconut oil over most others and I drink full fat milk instead of skimmed milk.

There are advantages that I believe in that are worth a whole other article and I don’t want to get on right here. Just wanted to leave that here.

 

*… and the Ugly*

Trans fats are the ones that you can have maybe if you really, really want on your Cheat Day, Load Day, Regain Day or whatever you want to call it. They really do no good and are generally a terrible decision to put in your body. I am not a monster and there is really tasty stuff that I very occasionally eat containing trans fats, but in general I avoid it like I do with sugar.

Trans fats we can find naturally-occurring and artificially produced. (I should add another heading saying “The really mother******g Ugly” to the latter) Milk and meat products made of animals who naturally produce trans fats may contain small quantities of these fats. But mankind decided it would be a really great idea to produce some artificial trans fats, too. Created in an industrial process by adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils, this stuff is mainly used to deep fry many of our favorite fast foods.

Trans fats raise bad (LDL) cholesterol levels, lower your good ones (HDL), increase risk for heart disease and stroke and is suspect to develop type 2 diabetes.

What a beast…

So like Superman wouldn’t choke down a fine chunk of Kryptonite very often, stop eating deep fried stuff and other processed products that contain trans fats such as:

* French fries
* Donuts
* Cakes
* Biscuits
* Frozen pizza
* Cookies
* Salty snacks
* Stick margarines
* Many highly processed instant foods (often microwave stuff)
 

Wow. Good learning about fat, huh? Just remember. Don’t be afraid of it. Look for good unsaturated fats. And frankly, if you stop eating processed things and go big on natural foods like veggies, meats, nuts and so on, you will encounter a super small amount of fats you should avoid by default.

 

*Carbs (Carbohydrate)*

Carbohydrates provide fuel. They are considered the main source of energy for the human body. Our system turns carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar) and it is then used for energy.

We differentiate between simple and complex carbohydrates. Besides the chemical structure the important difference is in how quickly the sugar is absorbed and digested. Simple carbohydrates are digested and absorbed more quickly than complex ones thus they can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels and sugar highs, while complex carbs provide more sustained energy.

Simple carbs include sugars found naturally in foods such as fruits, vegetables, milk, and milk products. But they can also be found in candy, soda and syrups. These by the way are made with processed and refined sugars and do not have any vitamins, minerals or fiber. You know what they call them? “Empty calories”. If that doesn’t sound like something we should avoid on our plate, then I don’t know what does.

Complex carbs are often referred to as starchy foods. Examples are whole-grain breads and cereals, peas, parsnips, peanuts, beans, potatoes and corn.

If carbs are such an important source for energy why all these low carb diets? Because many people don’t find the balance. The western world diet is pretty overloaded with carbs. Our body breaks down carbs into sugar. As said before sugar can spike blood sugar levels. Our blood sugar is regulated by insulin. The more carbs, the more sugar, the more insulin. And if we screw it up the insulin is going rogue and drops your blood sugar level real low. Our bodies reaction to this is calling for more sugar. We get “hungry”. The problem is storing all of that sugar we made out of our carbs. If it is not immediately needed for energy and the glycogen stores are full, carbs are stored as fat.

You see why those diets that are reducing carbs work? More Protein and less insulin that come through carbs make you not eat so much. Thus you reduce calories. Plus chances are lower that unused sugar is stored as fat.

 

*Some popular diets in the fitness industry*

As you will see many of the popular diets reduce carbs. But please don’t ban them, don’t hate them, don’t be afraid of them. Carbs are important. If you read carefully you figured out that anything artificially and highly processed as well as sugar is a problem. And for all other carbs it’s just that keeping the balance is essential otherwise more fat gets stored in your fat storage.

However looking at any of these diets can be a good idea, I think. The trick is to adapt to the diet and have the diet adapt to you. Take any of them as a guideline and see what you need to change and what works. Of course this doesn’t mean to change everything and to replace, say vegetables with a double chocolate cookie. Keep the balance. Be smart. Generally if you focus on good and real food, you don’t have to worry. Is my diet carb-reduced? Yes, it is. I made my experiments and my body is just not responding to carbs very well. I am a lot healthier and fitter by going a bit low on carbs. But more later. Here is what you can try.


 
*The Zone Diet*

The goal here is to aim for a nutritional balance of 40% carbohydrates, 30% fats, and 30% protein for each meal. This diet encourages good quality carbohydrates (unrefined) and good fats as mentioned above.

 

*Vegan Diet*

I can imagine that the vast majority of vegan people do so for many other reasons rather than to lose weight. However it is a healthy way of living and could be considered if you plan to change your eating habits anyway. Vegans do not eat anything that is animal based, including dairy, honey and eggs.

 

*Mediterranean Diet*

Aaaaahhh. Italian food. Pizza and Pasta mmmmmmhhhh. I’ll take that one.  OK, wait, that is not what it is. The Mediterranean Diet is Southern European, yes. However it is focuses on the nutritional habits of the people. Going that route you’re be eating plenty of plant foods, fresh fruits, cereals, seeds, olive oil, cheese and yogurt. Also poultry and up to about four eggs per week. Moderate consumption of red meat and fish. Around 30% of this diet consisting of healthy fats.

 

*The Ketogenic diet*

This one I find interesting. Going keto is basically going high in fat, low in carbs and reasonable in protein. Fat is consumed in a 4:1 ratio to carbs and protein together. Also high carb foods like bread, starchy fruits and vegetables are cut from the plan.

 

*Slow Carb diet*

This one I first heard from author Tim Ferris. In his book *The 4-Hour Body* he presents the slow carb diet. It’s basically limiting carbs to the ones with a low glycemic index (lower rise in blood sugar and insulin). Starches and anything sweet (including fruit) are eliminated and you load up on protein, legumes and vegetables. Main foods: Veggies, eggs, meat, fish, beans, unsweetened tea or coffee, and water. All dairy products but cottage cheese, butter and ghee are out as well.

 

*Paleo Diet*

This one is also known as the Caveman Diet. Before you point at all the things that cavemen probably didn’t have a lot of access to neither, but is allowed in the paleo diet, keep in mind that this is just a symbol. Nobody really wants you to live like a caveman. Unless you wish to. Then please go ahead and live like a caveman 

The Paleo dieter eats only what humans ate millions of years ago. That’s all sorts of animals you could have hunted down (fish, lean meats) but also anything that grew around and you could pick up (fruit, veggies and nuts). Go full paleo and starchy veggies, dairy, all grains, and processed foods are out. There are some less strict version in which potatoes and rice are ok, too.

 

Oh man….. So much info. Just tell me what to do already!

First of all I have to say that neither of those life styles are easy when you are used to 20+ years of garbage food. This and the fact that all of them contain healthy food options and variety makes me happy. This means we get away a bit from the totally stupid fad diets we had a couple of years back in every magazine.

If you look carefully at what’s popular (and working for so many) you will see some things these diets have in common.

Cutting artificial and processed food altogether (this includes sodas ladies and gentlemen).
Reducing sweet foods (refined sugar cut as of point 1.).
Moderate carb intake. If so no white bread, pasta or other high glycamic index options but instead whole-grains and other low glycamic index foods.
Healthy fats and no trans fats.
Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables.
Rather high protein.
Follow these rules and you’ll be seeing results you would have never imagined.

 

*Main takeaways:*

Do not be afraid of fat nor carbs. Paleo is dead. Especially if you want to do a lot of exercise and need energy, good traditional carb sources like oats are fine. You can do what you want! You should not restrict yourself so much. If you like bread, try to tie it in. Go for whole-grain options and be careful. But it’s not gonna kill you. These are tools. Use them to shape a life style worth living and one that works for you. Pizza and candy didn’t work, but it does not mean full on Paleo or Vegan or Keto or whatever is the only solution.

 

*Which diet do I recommend?*

The one I live myself. I say go for Paleo. Take a good look at it. Paleo is great and the basis of my diet. However I modify it to my needs and to my life style.

First let me explain why I think Paleo is a good choice:

* focus lies on real foods and no processed crap
* you automatically reduce sugars
* and automatically reduce carbs (not cut them)
* dairy is not allowed, which can cause problems to a lot of people (and you would maybe never notice if you didn’t try a diet like this)
* it is simple to follow by just imagining what our good old cavemen would have found around

Downsides:

I believe dairy contains a lot of goodies that our body needs
I find myself lacking a bit of energy without traditional carbohydrate sources, if I need to go real heavy on my workouts
It can be expensive and difficult to find good energy sources and carbs without the easy available options
I picked the Paleo diet as the basic scheme and then looked what I liked and felt I needed. Then I added it. Doing that I always look for the best and most natural option. Dairy for example. I luckily have no problems with lactose, so I eat dairy. I think if you aggressively want to lose weight you should reduce it. However I will never cut it from my diet. It doesn’t hurt me and I like cheese! Really, really do.

For carbs I go for good and healthy sources, but I have to admit the cavemen would have not found them in the bush. Whole grain bread but also rice sometimes. I do so only when I need the energy. On workout days and around my workouts. To fuel my muscles and give my body the fire it needs. On rest days I’d say I am more keto style. Maybe not so high amounts of fat though. But barely any carbs.

 

*Bottom line:* choose a healthy diet. Examples above. I recommend Paleo. Check it out and do your best to follow the rules. When you cannot live with one or the other thing don’t stress yourself. Cut garbage food. You know what that is. And load up on veggies and good food resources. You do need proteins for you muscles. Carbs and fat are nothing to be scared off.

Enjoy life and hero up!

dairy AND quality,6ckp1a,Please help me get enough fiber &amp; veggies while on a cut,nutrition,15,0.81,"Hi guys, I started a cut last week (225 lbs -&gt; 180 lbs) and after reading this sub a little, discovered that my diet was nowhere close to the recommend amount of fiber (38g/day for men?) or veggies. I should mention that I am lactose-intolerant so any foods with dairy (yogurt, cottage cheese, butter) won't work for me.

My current macros are as follows:

223g protein

168g carbs

75g fat

2234 kcal


I usually get fat from light olive oil (on my chicken) and hot dogs. I usually meet my protein and fat macros, but usually fall short on carbs (which is fine for me since I feel terrible with low fat and don't feel tired with less carbs). I usually eat 4 hot dogs for breakfast and then get my protein throughout lunch/dinner from 750g chicken tenderloins. If I'm feeling particularly adventurous, I'll try and eat ~200g brocolli florets, but that is a huge challenge (I microwave them and eat them without seasoning) because they just don't taste good. I'm not sure if other people season their brocolli florets with something to make it taste a lot better, or if I should just force myself eat it.

Now my question for you guys is if you could help me find foods that would fit into my diet (or if you can help me redesign my diet with my usual staples and still meet macros) so that I could get the right amount of fiber and veggies. I'll be honest with you guys, I rarely eat veggies and as a result rarely got any fiber in my diet in the past 4 years I've been in college. I'm trying to address that now, but I need your help :)

I was thinking that brocolli florets (linked below) might work for both veggies/fiber, but then realized that to get the 34g of fiber needed, I would need 17 servings (i.e. 1445g or 3.18 lbs) and that by itself would exceed my kcal amount. Not to mention that I have trouble even eating 200g. I was thinking maybe mixing beans, or an alternate source of fiber/veggies would be a better option.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1bxemk/do_i_really_need_fiber_in_my_diet/c9b12oq/) suggests I increase fiber by 2-5g per day each week while I aim for my 38g goal. That sounds good to me!

dairy AND quality,36hz09,Post-gallbladder removal supplements,nutrition,7,1.0,"Hello all,

I had my gallbladder removed 5 days ago. I'm still healing, and have just started eating solids (white rice). My doctor has informed me that my gallbladder has not been working for the last year, so anything that I've eaten and tolerated within that time frame is fine for me to continue consuming (which is almost everything).

Here's my question. I know that supplements are recommended after removal, especially before meals. I was curious what types, and if there are any specific good brands to get. As with vitamins, I'm sure there are brands that are a little more or less accurate as to the amount of the supplement per dose, quality differences, etc.

Thanks in advance!",2015-05-19,
dairy AND quality,p8nhc,All About Calories  |  What are they &amp; how many do I really need?!,nutrition,20,0.52,"All About Calories!



We all know what a calorie is.  We’ve read how many there are on the packaging of our favorite foods.  We’ve counted them in hopes of shedding pounds (or gaining them!).  But what does the majority of the public *really* know about the almighty calorie?  I mean, what are calories?  Let’s break it down!

 

So what the heck is a calorie?

Technically speaking, a calorie is a measure of energy.  More specifically, 1 calorie is the exact amount of energy that you would need to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.  Note the highlighted word: ENERGY!  Calories are the energy that feed all of the activities going on within our bodies.  Not just muscles during exercise, but every single organ in the body at all times is expending energy.  If we think of the human body as being like a car, the calories are essentially the fuel that our bodies run on.  Without them we have no energy, feel tired, hungry, our muscles waste away, and other things as well.  This is why proper caloric intake is essential to living a healthy life and getting the most out of your body!

So now that we know what a calorie is, are all foods equal in the caloric playing field?  Not quite.  In fact, the amount of calories in a food depends on which specific group it falls into:  Fat, carbohydrate, protein, and (saved the best for last?!) alcohol.

* Fats:  These are things like butter, lard, cheese, oils, and things of that nature.  Fats contain 9 kcal(or calories, as most people call it) per gram.  Being so energy dense, it’s easy to see why today’s typical high-fat American diet is leading to outrageous obesity rates across the country and, increasingly, the entire western world.
    
* Carbohydrates: Ah, the dreaded carbs!  Often made a villain by proponents of low-carb dieting, carbs are essential for your body, especially your brain.  Carbs are things like breads, sugar, many different vegetables, etc.  Carbs contain 4 kcal/g.
   
* Protein:  Muscle building protein!  Everyone knows we need it, and most Americans get more than their fair share of protein their diet.  Protein can come in many different forms, whether it be supplements, soy beans, or meat and dairy products.  Protein also contains 4 kcal/g.
   
* Alcohol:  Alcohol, which some people might think would be grouped with carbohydrates, is actually in a group by itself.  It contains 7 kcal/g, which is only 2 less than fat.  This why people who get trashed and binge drink frequently end up packing on a pound or 40.  All those drinks add up FAST, and you’re getting nothing nutritious with all of those calories, either.

So as we can see, food choices make a huge impact on the amount of calories that you’re going to consume in a day.  Let’s imagine there’s a juicy 10 oz. steak in front of you.

**OM NOM NOM NOM**

Now, we know that a steak is protein with fat.  Let’s imagine for a second that we could make the entire steak suddenly turn into 100% fat (while still retaining the taste of the steak).  That 10 oz steak would be a whopping 2,520 calories.

If the steak was comprised  of 100% protein or carbs it would only amount to a total of 1120 calories.  That’s 56% less calories for the *same amount of food!*

So with that in my mind, think about what your diet is currently like.  If you’re like most Americans, it is probably comprised largely of protein (and not the healthier kinds either!), with a higher amount of fat consumption than is recommended, and a lot of carbs from junk sources like potatoe chips or candy.  The reason for this is our current on-the-go lifestyle where quickness &amp; convenience often comes out on top over taking care of our health.  The current U.S. obesity rates clearly reflect this.


This is why choosing food that is **NUTRIENT DENSE as opposed to CALORIE DENSE** is essential.  Going back to the car analogy from earlier, think of nutrient dense food like healthy vegetables and lean proteins as premium racing fuel.  You only have one body that you’ve been given in this life, and if you fuel it with the best stuff you can, it’s going to perform wonderfully for you for many years to come.  However, if you’re pouring ultra-cheap, unprocessed, dirty fuel down into the gas tank, problems are going to arise sooner rather than later.

*""So how many calories do I need every day?  2,000, right?""*

Most people are familiar with the old “2,000 calorie a day diet”, upon which all serving size recommendations are currently based.  The reason that 2,000 is the magic number for labels is basically because it’s a nice round number.  The FDA once requested public comments on their proposal for a standard daily caloric intake of 2,350 calories, but the majority of people who commented on the proposal thought that seemed too high, and liked 2,000 better.  The reasoning they may give is that it’s close to the caloric requirement of postmenopausal women, who are most likely to gain weight.

The truth is, most men typically want to consume anywhere between 2,000-3,000 calories per day (with athletes and very muscular men often consuming way in excess of that), with women typically consuming between 1,600-2,200, and children consuming 1,800-2,500.  The reason for these differences is obvious.  Men are generally bigger and have more muscle mass, which requires more calories per day (muscle is more metabolically active than fat!).  The reason that children consume more calories than most adult women is that they are in their growing years and often need a large amount of calories to coincide with proper growth into adulthood.   In the end, the reason they most likely chose 2,000 as the number is to make it easy on the general public to understand and compare labels.

That being said, how many calories you should be consuming really depends on your specific goals.  Are you a woman trying to lose weight?  Are you a man trying to put on lots of muscle mass?  Are you a marathon runner?  All of these different questions require different amounts of calorie consumption, and different types of calories as well (lifters would want more protein in their diet, while a marathoner would benefit from a higher carb diet).  It’s really not rocket science.  Look at what you’re eating on a weekly basis and weigh in.  Try and cut some bad calories out of your diet and replace them with healthier options throughout the week, and weigh in.  If you like the progress, repeat during the next week.  If it wasn’t enough for you, revamp that diet even more until you start seeing the results that you want!

 

Don’t let calories scare you from attacking your diet and making it as healthy as you can.  Just because you’re eating a lot of calories during the day doesn’t necessarily mean you’re eating a lot of junk!  Make sure that all of your calories are coming from quality sources and you’ll see immediate changes in both how you look and feel.

 

Hope this somebody finds this helpful and if you have any questions I'll be more than happy to keep answering them  :]  Just an article I wrote up in my spare time, I have a B.S. in Nutritional Sciences btw!

dairy AND quality,1l4g58,Lifestyle interventions and diabetes: what you need to know,nutrition,8,0.4,"Here's an article that can be found on www.jennovafoodblog.com (Author-Jennifer Novakovich) - What are your thoughts?

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an up and coming chronic disease that currently affects about 25.8 million people in the US, with about 1.9 million of those individuals under the age of 20. Approximately 35% of U.S. adults fall into the pre-diabetic range, while an estimate 12.0% have diabetes. When diagnosed midlife, T2DM is associated with a loss of 10 years off of lifespans and is associated with a fourfold higher risk for heart disease, which is responsible for up to 80% of the deaths in people with diabetes. On top of that, diabetes is a major risk factor for premature blindness, need for amputation and kidney failure. In 2010, diabetes accounted for 11.6% of the total health-care expenditure in the US. T2DM in Children is a new concept that has emerged over the last few decades, with most of the cases before-hand being type 1. Because diabetes is increasingly prevalent in younger individuals, it is expected to result in a devastating blow to the health of future working-age individuals. Are you or someone you know struggling with diabetes? Read on for more information and tips to help you on your road to recovery.

The control of blood sugar is essential for good health; both high (&gt;7mM) and low (&lt;4mM) blood sugar can be detrimental and potentially fatal. Blood sugar levels in healthy humans are tightly regulated to maintain about 5mM sugar concentrations throughout the day. Our muscles, fat cells, organs and brain (predominantly skeletal muscle) are responsible for the uptake of sugar following a meal via glucose transporters (GLUT4) at their cell membranes. This uptake is highly dependent on insulin stimulation which is released from the pancreas. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose at the cell membranes to lower blood sugar whereas glucagon promotes the release of glucose from the liver to increase blood sugar. Healthy blood sugars are maintained largely by the release of these two hormones.

How does diabetes happen? T2DM is a chronic and progressive beta cell (cells in the pancreas that release insulin) dysfunction that results in insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. The main risk factor for diabetes is too many daily calories, either through too little exercise or too much food (or both). When we chronically overeat or eat high glycemic diets, sugar is constantly being pumped into our blood. To deal with higher blood sugar, insulin is released from the pancreas to stimulate the uptake of glucose. When insulin is chronically released, eventually our tissues, specifically our glucose transporters, become less sensitive to insulin. At that point, our body becomes less capable of taking up glucose so blood sugar remains high; insulin resistance is the term for this condition. The net effect of high blood sugar is poor protein production, acidosis, etc. In this early stage of diabetes where reduced insulin sensitivity is present, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can be reversed through a variety of interventions including a change in lifestyle or medication.

In terms of pharmaceutical treatment options, metformin and insulin are currently the only medicines approved by the US FDA for the treatment of T2DM in youth. Although insulin is effective at lowering blood sugar, it results in a need for future injections and a risk for hypoglycemia. Furthermore, insulin inherently improves the body’s ability for fat storage and protein production. Since obesity and high body fat are major factors for insulin resistance, insulin injections tend to feed into a vicious cycle that often prevents patients from improving and recovering. Metformin is a widely used drug that acts as a glucose sensitizer, suppressor of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose production with a low risk for long-term side effects. Although metformin is quite effective, reducing risks for diabetes by 31%, it is still less effective compared to lifestyle interventions. 

With all of that said, here are 5 components to consider while undergoing a lifestyle intervention geared for diabetes prevention and treatment…

1) Diet 

In terms of diet, recommendations include a reduction in portion sizes, fat and sugar, increases in fruit and vegetable consumption, and an elimination of high-sugar beverages. The key for insulin sensitivity improvements seems to be weight loss and overall lower caloric intakes. The percentage of daily macronutrients (e.g. fat, carbs, and protein) ideal for improvement is still unclear and there is evidence for improvements at just about any percentage. For example, high protein diets and high-fibre, low glycemic diets have been both demonstrated to improve satiety and insulin sensitivity. Fibre also effectively decreases total and LDL cholesterol and decreases inflammation and can be commonly found in plant-based foods (e.g. nuts, seeds, fruits, beans, lentils, flax, legumes, carrots, etc). Ketogenic, low-calorie diets have also been demonstrated to improve insulin sensitivity. With all of that said, too little evidence is available on the ideal levels of carbs, fat and protein in a diet to suggest macronutrient adjustments. 

The case for vegetarian diets

Plant based diets have long been used for improving insulin sensitivity, weight loss and lowering risks for heart disease. Vegetarian diets are traditionally defined as the absence of meat but there are many variations including lacto-vegetarians (includes dairy), lacto-ovo-vegetarians (includes eggs and dairy), pesco-vegetarian (includes fish) and vegan (no animal products). Overall, vegetarians tend to be slimmer, at a lower risk for chronic diseases and have a greater longevity then omnivores. Epidemiological data supports the notion of diabetes prevention with plant-based diets. For example, vegetarians have been demonstrated to have overall lower fasting blood sugar, cholesterol and TAG levels, however results are confounded by the weight-loss associated with plant-based diets.

With that said, are there specific dietary components in vegetarian diets protective against disease? Vegetarian diets tend to include more fruits and vegetables, which are rich in phytochemicals, antioxidants and fibre and are consistently associated with a lower risk for diabetes and other chronic diseases. Vegetarian diets also tend to be low in omega-6 and saturated fat, which has been shown to have positive effects on blood lipids and insulin sensitivity. Excess iron sores, associated with meat consumption, has also been shown to promote insulin resistance. Reduced calorie intakes will happen naturally on a plant based diet through a lower fat content, lower energy density and higher overall fibre content, so calorie counting is not typically required in order to lose weight, which seems to be the key to improve insulin sensitivity. 

Red and processed meat intake has been consistently linked with T2DM, heart disease and certain cancers. Red meat consumption is associated with a 42% higher risk for heart disease with each 50g/day. Furthermore, 50g/day has been linked with a 19% higher risk of diabetes and frequent processed meat intake was associated with a 41% higher risk for diabetes. The lack of meat in vegetarian diets may also be a contributing factor for insulin sensitivity improvements.

If you’re thinking of trying out a vegetarian diet, here are a few tips to make sure you do it in a healthy way. Firstly, since plant-based iron is less bioavailable than animal based iron, make sure you couple your iron sources (e.g. greens) with vitamin C rich foods (e.g. citrus fruits), which effectively increase their bioavailability. Vitamin B12 is almost only found in animal based products and deficiencies can result in serious health consequences. Supplementation with vitamin B12 is vital while on a vegetarian diet in order to avoid a deficiency. Lastly, vitamin D supplementation is important, especially in northern latitudes with less sunlight exposure or during the winter (important for everyone, not just vegetarians). Despite what many people think, protein is not a big concern for vegetarians and as long as a complete amino acid profile is consumed throughout the day, easily achieved through healthy servings of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes, we can get more than enough protein. If your still concerned or like the idea of adding protein to your shakes to boost satiety in between meals, head over to your local health store and check out the vegan protein supplements. Sunwarrior and Vega both make excellent protein supplements. My favorites are Sunwarrior’s Vanilla Warrior Blend and the Vega One French Vanilla shake.

2) Exercise

Exercise results in improved insulin sensitivity, increased uptake at the muscle, and a reduced need for medication, having the greatest influences as the intensity of the exercise increases. In the Finnish Diabetes Prevention study, for example, participants enrolled did 30 minutes of exercise per day, lost weight, lowered their saturated fat intake and increased their fibre intake had a 58% lower incidence of diabetes after the trial. In the ‘Nurses’ Health Study and Physician’s Health Study, vigorous exercise almost halved risks for developing T2DM. Current guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate to vigerous aerobic exercise weekly, based on the large body of evidence that exercise helps prevent diabetes, heart disease and all-cause mortality. This recommended time has been demonstrated to reduce diabetes risks by 58%! High Intensity Training (HIT) seems to be extremely effective at inducing a number of changes at the skeletal muscle including fibre composition, angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis, with the end result of significantly improved insulin sensitivity. 

Getting started exercising can be a daunting task, especially if it’s been a while since you’ve hit the gym or been on that high school sports team. Rest assured, achieving that 150 minutes isn’t as hard as it seems, and once you get going you’ll only be happy with the improvements you see. The best way to go is to find something that you enjoy so you’ll stick to it! Intermurals are a great way to reconnect with your inner child, have fun and meet new people. Interested in some group classes? Most colleges and gyms offer some pretty stellar fitness classes that will have you fit in no time. Looking for a new sport? There are so many adult leagues available to get you started; it’s never too late to find a new passion (rock climbing anyone?)! 

3) Support

Social support has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, reduce symptoms and increase the commitment of patients to lifestyle interventions. Higher levels of social support have been associated with better glycemic control, more knowledge, better adherence to treatment and an overall improved quality of life. It is also helpful in accepting a diagnosis, adjusting emotionally and decreasing the stress associated with diabetes. On the flip side, a lack of social support is associated with a higher risk for complications and death. If you’re trying a lifestyle intervention, make sure you have the support you need to ensure your success. Let your family members, significant other or friends know that you need a little encouragement. Support groups may also be a good idea or even teaming up with others (e.g. friends or family) while doing these lifestyle changes.

4) Sleep

Sleep deprived individuals reportedly have a 35% greater chance of gaining more than 5kg over the course of 6 years. Lack of sleep (less than 6 hours per night) alters our metabolisms in profound ways, the end results are dramatic; insulin resistance, decreased energy requirements, enhanced appetites and damaged immune systems. When treating diabetes, good sleep habits are essential! Getting to bed earlier can be hard at first but with time your body will adjust to this new routine. If your having a hard time falling asleep earlier, try dimming the lights in your home throughout the day and avoiding electronics within the few hours before trying to fall asleep. This includes TV, computers and data phones which all have bright screens. Avoiding bright lights before bedtime is an effective way to get you sleepier and more relaxed.

Bonus

My last consideration would be to include some anti-diabetic food items into your daily routine. A few of my favorite options include green tea, turmeric, aloe, garlic, ginger and apple cider vinegar. Try incorporating a few of these items every day to help you on your way to better insulin sensitivity.

dairy AND quality,pp0s1,From Guidelines to Groceries – Dietary Fat,nutrition,1,0.5,"Posted on February 14, 2012 by Professor Vitamin Professor Vitamin

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans published by the United States Department of Agriculture recommends that we keep our fat intake between 20 and 35% of the daily energy intake, and no more than 10% of our energy from saturated fats. Furthermore, daily cholesterol intake should be less than 300 mg. For an individual consuming 2,000 kcal/day, the fat intake should be between 44 and 78 grams/day; unfortunately, the typical Western diet contains 90-100 grams of fat per day.

It’s one thing to be armed with this information and it’s another to put it into practice in the supermarket. Here are some practical points:

    Read the Nutrition Facts label if it is available on the packaging.
    When choosing beef or pork, the cuts with a name that includes “loin” or “round” have less fat than “chuck”.
    When choosing dairy products such as cheese or milk, skim (no fat) or low-fat products are better choices than regular products.
    Dark meat in poultry has more fat than the white meat. Skinless poultry products have less fat than the ones with skin.
    Commercially prepared grain products generally have more fat content than grain products in their natural form or home-made products.
    Choose fresh fruits and vegetables when possible. They have no fat or are low-in-fat and have no cholesterol. The two exceptions are avocados and olives, though the fat in these foods are mostly polyunsaturated fats that are not harmful to your heart’s health.
    Beware of hidden fat. Many of the commercially prepared products are high in fat content. Examples are pastries, pie crusts, muffins, breakfast bars, etc. All varieties of nuts are high in fat. Using nuts to replace foods with high saturated fats is a healthy choice. However, even though the fat in nuts are considered as good fats, too much of them will create a positive energy balance and increase your weight.
    Substitute wisely. Some foods labeled “low-fat” may not be low in calories. A case in point is peanut butter. Two tablespoons of regular peanut butter has 16 grams of fat and 190 kcal while the reduced fat version has 12 grams of fat and 190 kcal.

How can a product with reduced fat content still have the same amount of calories as its regular fat version? Fat makes food taste good. When fat content is reduced, the flavor goes with it. Food manufacturers have to make up the taste loss by adding some carbohydrates (sugar) to it. The result is no reduction in calories.

This does not mean that all reduced fat foods are high in calories. However, when we see the “reduced fat” wording, we have been programmed to link the statement to “reduced calories” and tend to be more inclined to purchase the item. Therefore, reading the Nutrition Facts label is the best way to ascertain that the reduced fat food items are also low in calories.

The following are some examples of smart substitutions:
Instead of 	Use 	Fat grams reduced
A large croissant 	Oat bran, ½ cup 	9
Whole milk, 8 oz 	Skim milk, 8 oz 	8
Regular ground beef, 3 oz 	Ground round, 3 oz 	10

After watching some diet and nutrition videos and reading some articles, I realize that some of the ""run of the mill"" grocery store meat / dairy sources may not be the best for you.

For example, ground turkey is an extremely good source of protein on paper. However according to a video I recently watched, most turkeys which are processed and become ground turkey are fed a diet high in Soy which leads to increased estrogen and other undesirable hormones within the meat.

However, this table shows that fats that I have been led to believe are more harmful (canola and various seed oils) are actually better at improving lipid levels that are associated with heart disease than the fats I have understood to be healthy (olive oil, coconut oil, grass fed butter, high fat grass fed meat, etc). I thought olive oil was the one unassailable fat, loved by blue zone diet adherents, paleos, ketos, saturated fat avoiders and the like. So how do you avoid bias and which fats should I be eating?

I have found that eating coconut makes me ill (paleo). Almonds need to be very limited or I start feeling ill (used for dessert substitutes in paleo). When I have soy in my diet (eating soy yogurt, or dairy substitutes mostly) I tend to feel very cold all the time. I have discovered that my body can't handle broccoli, cabbage, apples.

I'm an eighteen year old female who weighs something around 118lbs @ 5'7"".  I don't work out at all but I do stand/walk around for long periods of time at my job, as well as sometimes walking about town. I have eaten a mostly whole food diet for seven months now based around organic/grass-fed meats, some full fat dairy and whey protein, pastured butter, olive and coconut oil, dark chocolate, lots of vegetables/squash, and occasionally white rice, potatoes, or honey/fruit. 

Prior to starting this I had terrible energy levels and an irregular menstrual cycle as well as a lot of acne. When I DID get my period, it was debilitating. My menstrual cycle stabilized once I started eating whole foods and my cramps got to where they were almost a nonexistent. My energy levels are wonderful and my acne is a lot better (though I still would break out around a week before my period). I am also a lot less depressed.

When I became a vegan, it was also when I became increasingly aware of my nutrition. I never ate extremely unhealthily, and while I was maybe a bit heavier than I should've been, it was when I was young (I became vegan when I was 17 years old, so I'm not sure if my weight fluctuations during my middle- and high-school years were due to my diet or normal weight fluctuations during growth). After I went vegan, I lost some weight, and my weight has varied within ten pounds since I've gone vegan.

Again, the quality of the food I have been eating has definitely improved since I've gone vegan, but how I feel has not. I often feel hungry, even right after a meal I usually do not feel satisfied. Also, I get tired pretty early in the day, despite usually getting about 7.5 hours of sleep a night. I also often feel a lack of energy and lethargy, and get cold easily. I'm only 19 years old--I shouldn't feel like this.

I am an avid runner, running 4-6 miles a day, though I do still worry about the quantity of food I am eating, as I am small (5') and do not want to gain weight.

I am trying to limit gluten in my diet, as I have a cousin with Celiac, and believe I may have a sensitivity as well. I mainly stick to oatmeal, plenty of vegetables, some fruits, potatoes, beans, chickpeas, tofu, and tempeh.

It's also hard for me to eat healthy, much less vegan, because for the next four months I'm living in a dorm, so I'm limited to my school's dining hall or the microwave in my room. My school has a salad bar which is pretty decent, and stir fry, but strangely enough, the specifically vegan meals they prepare are starch-heavy and light on the vegetables, with terrible portions. 

Even if I did eat meat/animal products, I would be just as limited because everything else here is not great for you--sandwiches, burgers, pizza, pasta, etc. And the meat/eggs are definitely not organic/grass-fed/etc. anyway, though I'm pretty hesitant to go back to eating animal products, but I'm wondering if perhaps a vegan diet just isn't for me. I was a pescatarian for a few years before I went vegan, and ate a lot of cheese and eggs. I definitely do not miss dairy, though, but am wondering if perhaps at the moment I don't get enough protein or fat.

Has anyone struggled with similar issues? I don't like feeling hungry all the time, and while I don't want to go back to eating meat and eggs, I do remember never feeling like this while I ate it. My dietician always told me to eat more whole grains, but I don't think that's the solution. Can anyone help me out or give me some advice?

Digestion improved too. But my shits are a little uncomfortably brightly coloured compared to usual.

If you live in USA or the EU there are some swedish specialist stores that let you try it out

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars

The best part of ""fil"" is that you can make your own once you got a first pack. Just follow this recipy:

----------------------------------

How to: swedish ""Fil"" milk

BUY ""YMP"" - Purchase buy a packet of filmjölk (Like verum hälsofil / a-fil / Långfil) of a natural (nonflavoured) type that you like and that contains live bacterial culture. It will be used as a seed to grow the beneficial bacteria strain from it and thus get the right taste and texture on your ""fil"" milk. You only use a little bit of it each time you make a batch of Fil milk, so the package will last for a long time. Freeze the excess divided into small air tight packages, then you have new starter if you end up needing it. You can use any pasteurized milk you want, but it will be best with a fatter variant (eg standard 4% fat milk).

Heat the regular milk first. Heat until it is almost boiling. You should see small bubbles in the saucepan, but it should not boil. The heating will kill all unwanted bacteria so that the good bacteria can get the upper hand. If you use pasteurized buttermilk and clean tools, you can skip step this step.

MIX IN THE YMP - Let the milk to cool to room temperature. Then mix in a little starter fil milk/YMP. Some tablespoons of it per liter of milk are usually good.

LET IT REST - Let the mixture stand at room temperature overnight (or until it is ready).

STORE COLD - Keep it in the refrigerator when it is ready, otherwise it will continue to ferment and become alcoholic. Totally worth it though but kinda tricky to get the right alcoholic content. If the ready-made ""fil"" milk tastes or smells bad then you should not eat it. In that case, it will be bad and you will have to throw it out and restart with a fresh batch.

SAVE SMALL BATCHES - Once you have eaten almost the entire film milk, you save only one slice that you use as grafting on the next rate (instead of using bacon milk). You can continue to grab the last sludge for any length of time, so you do not have to start over again with buying new ""Fil"" milk/YMP.

It actually started out as a traditional dish where farmers would keep a starter like some bakers would keep sourdough starters. Then they shared the starters with eachother for taste and to replace a batch thats gone bad.

Ymp is just a swedish name for the piece of the ""Fil"" milk that you save to make new Fil milk with.

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars. I can dig it up or get some email/phone numbers for you if youre interested.

You can always email the verum folks over here if youre interested in more recipies or starter packs or whatever else: forum@norrmejerier.se

Theres more contact info over here: https://verum.se/kontakt/

If you want to try this then I think A-fil and Långfil are the easiest to do it with. Verum Hälsofil can be done but it contains so many millions of bacteria per dl that it tend to grow rather quickly so you need to keep a closer eye on it.

For the sake of not introducing bad bacteria I would stick to using small frozen packets of the initial Fil milk. Make sure they are air tight and has as little air in the bag as possible. Then put the bags collected in an airtight container.

If nothing else you'll have an interesting special dish to take out when you're hungover or got visitors.

I personally enjoy putting a bit of salt in it and ice cubes during the summer with a little splash of wayer. Then I drink it with a straw like the turkish Ayran yoghurtdrink.

Its a bit unusual and I have not seen much discussion on the topic elswehere on the site. So I'm curious to hear what you think of the nutrition qualities of this type of fermented dairy?

dairy AND farmers,uoni5,"I'm writing this on behalf of my wife. This is in regards to a yeast free diet.
",nutrition,29,0.7,"My wife has been dealing with a yeast infection/BV (I'm honestly not sure what you call it) for nearly two years. We have been seeing a local gynecologist the entire time without getting any results. They recently referred us to an infection specialist. This worried my wife and myself but we knew we were going to do whatever was best for her. What we decided to do before seeing the infection specialist was to see another gynecologist for a second opinion. The second doctor we saw was amazing. My wife wanted me in the room with her when she had her exam to help ask questions. The doctor stayed in there with us for nearly half an hour. I was very impressed. She told her things her old doctor did not. She gave her medicine her old doctor did not and explained to her that she had a strong strain of candida (?) and prescribed her boric acid and fluticasone (?). The other thing she gave us was a list of foods to not eat and a small list of foods that were allowed. There seems to be a bit of gray area on the list however. Also, it doesn't match perfectly with other lists I've seen online. What I was hoping was that I could post the list and you fine people give me your opinions. Also if you could give me an idea of recipes for such a diet it would be extremely helpful. My wife and I have not been eating well for quite a while and this will be a big change for us. We are excited about it but need a little bit of information and practice.



Yeast Free Diet - This is what the doctor gave us




**Avoid**



Brewers Yeast - I don't even know what that is
Chocolate
Coffee

Go light on tea, except green tea

All sweeteners including sugar, honey, maple syrup, stevia, Equal, corn syrup, evaporated cane juice, Splenda, sucralose, etc

Fruit Juice

Dried fruit, mushrooms, peanuts (raisins are dried fruit)

Citric Acid (like lemon, lime or orange

Vinegar and all vinegar products (mayo, mustard, salsa, dressings, etc)

All dairy including milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter - I have heard mixed things about yogurt. Is this bad to eat? What is the best substitute for milk?

Yeast in any form. Including most breads - Is there anything you can substitute for bread?
Soy sauce and all fermented products like sauerkraut and pickles

Processed meats that contain sodium nitrites. Eat only hormone free meats

Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Use olive oil instead - Is olive oil safe to cook with?

Spicy seasonings such as chili, cinnamon, pepper. Some herbs are ok including basil, thyme, oregano and parsley. - Is there any other herbs/spices that would be ok?

No fruit in any form including fresh, canned dried or frozen




**Allowed**



Vegetables - especially dark green leafy ones - What are examples of good dark green leafy vegetables?

Beans of any variety

Meat protein, including beef, poultry, fish, shellfish and fresh (uncured) pork. - What is uncured pork?

Eggs - When buying eggs should you buy the organic, cage free, grain fed eggs or is that over doing it?

Whole grains including rice, barley, millet, couscous and buckwheat - What is the difference between whole grain and whole wheat?

Whole grain oatmeal and pasta; corn, rice or spelt pasta

Unprocessed seeds and nuts - What is an unprocessed seed or nut?

Vegetable oils which are unrefined (the kind that must be refrigerated) - I have no idea what this is



We went to the grocery last night and picked up a few things. My wife had a grilled sirloin smothered with a tiny amount of garlic and steamed brussle sprouts sprinkled with salt. For breakfast she had unsweetened almond milk with shredded wheat. We also bought some fish (perch), pork chops, onions, oatmeal, cucumbers, rice, kidney beans and kale. I'm not sure how to prepare a lot of this. Also after leaving we realized there really wasn't a lot we can eat. We are happy with eating healthy we just don't know how to do it very well. If there is anyone who can give advice on how to cook any of the products I purchased or products I should purchase with an idea of how to cook it I will be very grateful.

My last thing I need help with is how to pick the perfect vitamin for my wife and whether or not we should take any supplements such as fish oil or acidophillus. My wife has never taken vitamins but once. I went and purchased her a once daily womens vitamin. They made her feel really bad. The doctor said it could have been the iron. I have no idea. Is there a vitamin that would be good for her to take? Is it good for all women to take vitamins? Also is there anything like acidophillus that a women should take when dealing with yeast? We are willing to try anything to make this go away.

I live in Estonia and it's fairly behind from other leading European countries considering wage but our the prices of products are throughout the same. I will do extensive research on information i can easily get simply by googling but one thing is to hear from real folks living there and other is just reading some articles. For example statistics say that in Estonia average wage is 800EUR, although it is as high simply because our government pays really much for it's high placed people.

It would help me a lot if someone could answer in a similar form described below:

Country: Estonia

Minimum-wage: 390 EUR / 2,34 EUR/h

Average wage: 600-700 EUR (not from statistics department just an average of what people really earn)

milk AND price,3d16vk,The Austerity Conspiracy,europe,23,0.37,"Hello everybody.

I'm about to tell you about the Austerity conspiracy. You might have heard that the Southern European countries have been forced to accept 'austerity' measures, and that any country that might disagree risks of being kicked out of the Eurozone, with Greece being a much discussed exampled in the last days.

If someone looks at Greece's numbers, he will discover that its GDP fell down about 25% since the 'austerity' started, its Debt to GDP ratio went from 110% to 180%, and its unemployment from 9.5% to 28%. The numbers speak for themselves, and make it clear that austerity is destroying Greece's economy. But there is more than that.

How is austerity destroying an economy such as that of Greece, and why do countries like Germany insist in more and more austerity, if it is so destructive to Greece's economy after all ? Doesn't Germany wants to take back the money it loaned to Greece ?

This is the official story that if you think about it doesn't really make much sense, But let's take a deeper look into it.

The Austerity measures are two things: Government cuts and tax rates increases.

What the increase in taxes like the VAT and the gasoline tax do, is to inflate the prices of everything produced in that country. Just making the fuels more expensive, has an immediate effect on everything, as everything needs to be shipped around, things such as food, clothes, electronic devices, absolutely everything. VAT increase also increases prices. So basically and clearly, what tax increases like those of austerity packages do, is price inflation of locally produced goods.

Now let me tell you a bit about how the Eurozone works. The markets of the Eurozone are united and globalized, and there are no fees aplied to imports / exports from one country to another. Neither there are conversion rates, as everybody is using the Euro. That means that someone from country A of the EZ can buy and import something from country B, and only have to pay the actual price of the product to the business selling it, and the shippment cost.

It is also a fact that bigger countries because they are bigger can produce larger quantities, and thus also less expensive, because price is set by the amount of production. That means that a German product for example of a given quality will be less expensive than an Italian or Greek product of the same quality.

Even without the austerity measures, larger countries like Germany have an advantage in the market over smaller ones, because they are able to produce and price their products at lower costs, which makes them more competitive.

That has been obvious since the Euro started being used, as German export rates were launched to the heavens, German supermarkets like Lidl showed up everywhere, and German products started being available at the other countries everywhere,  costing way less than local products.

Now factor in the fact that the biggest supporter of austerity is Germany. Germany is been pushing the other EZ countries to raise all their tax rates, which results to price inflation of local produced goods in the countries that adopt austerity, which makes them practically not affordable, while the German produced products are getting cheaper than ever, and the German companies more competitive than ever. Germany thus is making way more billions every month than what it gives as loans to anybody.


The Austerity policy the Southern countries are forced to follow is a conspiracy to make the products of these countries unaffordable to their citizens, for the shake of improving the competitiveness of German products, to raise German exports. In the mean time, the economies of the countries that apply austerity are squeezed and devastated, as they bleed money that Germany sucks, as an economic vampire.

That's what austerity is all about. Numbers speak for themselves, and its pretty clear for anyone who looks at the numbers, that after austerity the countries that adopted it started losing money, due to imports, while Germany's economy was boosted because of the increase in its exports.",2015-07-12,

The man asked why and the border officials explained that because of the Brexit, it is no longer allowed to import this type of product. **“Sorry, sir. This is Brexit.”** One of the agents said. That is an emblematic scene of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union effects. 

The agents strictly but correctly applied the new rules. Because from 11 pm on 31 December 2020, the UK officially left the European single market. And although Boris Johnson snatched a theoretically zero duty tariff-free trade agreement from the last, this still implies a huge number of customs declarations, up to tens of millions per year. But above all, some fresh products can no longer enter the European Union freely from the United Kingdom, now a non-EU country, even if you are a tourist, exactly, as it already happens at the US border. 

The rule applies above all to meat (whether fresh or cured) and cheeses and dairy products, for reasons of safety and health, as similar foods must be checked in advance by the authorities to avoid importing diseases. The United Kingdom, unlike the EU, still allows tourists and ordinary citizens to bring the ham, cheese, and in general dairy products and meats, if these come from the EU, also because however London cannot yet carry out such checks. So, barring a few misinformed British border agents, as the rules are, it is still possible to bring sandwiches, cold cuts, and cheeses from the EU to the UK, a rather common practice for many migrant workers and visitors.

Meanwhile, fruit and vegetables are starting to run out in an increasing number of UK supermarkets, as explained by an alarmed Daily Mail, one of the country’s most pro-Brexit newspapers. In Britain, the cause of the problem is the long lines of trucks seen in Dover in late December. When French President Emmanuel Macron closed the borders to stop the English coronavirus variant. The blockade and the long waiting discouraged many factories from shipping goods and merchandise at the Brexit beginning.

In Northern Ireland too, goods are starting to run out. The problem here is that, in turn, goods from Great Britain to and around Belfast have to undergo customs checks and declarations, although this takes place within the UK. According to the Brexit agreement between the Boris Johnson government and Brussels, London has to check many products before crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland.

David is pleasant and articulate with Oxford &amp; LSE degrees (gawked at Linked-In, he wasn't spoofing.) 

He voted to Remain…but now *""wishes he'd voted to Leave""!* For him it's morphed into ""bigger issues of national sovereignty &amp; immigration"". He thinks Merkel letting a million refugees into the reich was madness. 

David knows about GFA &amp; thorny NI aspects of Brexit, but isn't too worried about the Irish angle. Explained I regularly traveled over Border in 90s when it  looked like iron curtain. But thats all gone &amp; we'd really like it to *stay that way*. I outlined via e.g. Dairy Co-Ops that trade is so integrated, post-hard-Brexit UK will be hit hard. Forget about IRE, why shoot *yourselves* in the foot? Even May now acknowledges EU regs will stay in place re drug supply/banking/food etc. 

**David *knows* UK will take an economic blow from Brexit.** However he thinks **it's worth it to allow 'more control' over who comes into the place.** 

I politely observed even the 'best case' scenario, i.e. Norwegian model, will do four fifths of fuck all on that front.  Might even perversely increase undocumented UK immigration. As UK then hasn't much recourse, French could actively push through unfortunate Calais crew. And as per Brit gov promises, anybody will still be able to access^ahem ..'mainland' GB via scary Eire. 

David wasn't very concerned. He asked if living in US had impacted my take on Brexit. Replied I'm daily seeing the **unintended consequences of populism.** Convo was very civil yet hair pullingly frustrating.

I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports.

* Return train to Dublin: €43 - 83 (can be €28 for a 3 hr bus journey)
* Hotel accommodation in Dublin (Cheapest twin room in city centre 2 nights): 140PP
* Drinks: €5 avg per pint (€50 avg per day)
* Food: Breakfast €10 Lunch €15 dinner € 20 (45€ avg per day)

Alternatives:

* Return flight to Gdasnk: €39
* Hotel accommodation: €65pp (covers entire weekend in much nicer 2 bed apt in the city center)
* Price of a pint: €2.20 (€22 avg per day)
* Food: Avg meal in a cheap restaurant, according to numbeo: €5.70 (€20 avg per day)

**Total PP: €146 (Went for nicer accomodation)**

We would usually grab some lunch but have mostly stopped this due to the price increases and cheap ingredients a lot of places have switched to, but we would always grab a take out coffee for our walk around. 

We went in Saturday for the first time in a few weeks and I ordered our usual two coffee and hers with Oat milk as she is lactose intolerant and can’t drink dairy. 

Wasn’t paying too much attention as I was chatting with the girl at the counter so just tapped my phone and then noticed the price was 10.20. I looked at the menu and sure enough the coffees had gone up to 4.50 each so I asked about the extra 1.20 thinking I was overcharged. 

Girl told me no, they had a VAT increase recently and all prices went up and the milk went from 50cent to 1.20€. 

Checked back on my payments are last time we went (about 6 weeks ago) I paid 8.50 and now it’s 10.20. 

Told your one I thought 10.20 was scandalous for two coffees and she said that a few people had mentioned it, but didn’t want to start anything big with a minimum wage employee who has no control over prices. 

I work from home so tend to drink coffee at home during the week, so Saturday in town was probably the only one I’d get out and I enjoyed supporting a local business but fuck me there seems to be a right level of greed in some Irish business right now and charging 1.20 for a milk substitute for someone who actually needs it is terrible.

I love my kittens so much! They have brought me immeasurable joy. When they run to me in the morning, I feel my sadness lift.

However, when I first got my cats, I spent a silly amount of money buying expensive things from the pet store. I also bought a lot of unnecessary things. After 3+ months with my cats, I have compiled a list of things that I actually use for my cats. I also have the revelation that cats don’t care for price, so I might as well buy on the cheap.

This is my to buy list with links. I have no affiliation to any business or anything. I just want to share the cat love.

Important Things That I Wish I knew

1. I have to scoop our tray every day and completely change litter every couple of days. Clumping litter is handy

2. My cats sometimes wake me up in the middle of the night 

3. Kittens need to be fed 3 times per day and cats need to be fed 2 times per day 

4. Kittens are happy to stay alone for a few hours per day. Cats can stay alone for a day 

5. Cats cannot drink milk. They need a special type of milk. My cats drink water

6. Cats need to be vaccinated/dewormed/check-up every year. You can join a vet plan for €20 per month. This will cover all your routine visits. However, it will not cover any emergency visits. Also, your insurance is dependent on you having regular check-ups with a vet 

7. Cats get sick for all sorts of reasons. Cats don’t always land on their feet. If your cat swallows an object. It can cost you anywhere north of €1,000 to save fluffy. Insurance is so important. I got it for €10.00 per month

8. Timed-release feeders are not always reliable

9. Cats can be messy. My kittens toss their food and litter all over the floor. Enclosed litter trays were an excellent solution 

10. Cats get lonely if they are on their own for too long. A second cat can be a great option if feasible 

11. It costs €20 to register your microchip. It is covered by the €20 p/m vet fee. It is essential because if your pet wanders (which they will, any vet can scan it and find out the owners and contact details)",2022-08-23,

Ireland AND milk AND price,nq1h8g,Controversial (?) opinion on Dublin from a foreigner living in Ireland for the last 7 months,ireland,178,0.89,"I came in Ireland in October, originally to study (a phd, i am 25, long story, dropped out, now working remote).

I was kind of enthusiastic because it was one of my top choices around Europe : friendly people, English language, Ryanair flying you cheap everywhere, walkable city.

All these proved true.

I like how easily I can walk around most of Dublin's center, how good the public transport is, how friendly the people are usually.

But I came to realize that at my view, Ireland is run in a horrible way from a young person's POV. The best way to describe it is that they treat young people as pretty much ""not my business"".

The rents situation is insane and from all the people I've spoken with, there is not a single politician willing to do something for the issue.

It is not normal to need to share a house with strangers because if I want to rent alone, rent would cost almost 70% of my salary.It is not normal to see other young people having to share a room (!) because of the extreme prices.It looks like the Irish politicians don't care about that, that they want to shape the housing market for the owners, who are usually 40-50 years old people, and completely ignore the younger people.

Sinn Fien is - from what I've understood - the only ones that support changes in the system, but these changes are mostly directed towards the very poor of the society. Which is great, and 100% needed, but I don't see them representing the interests of the younger generation either. Am I wrong? Have they suggested ways to make living alone affordable for young people? Has ANY political party in Ireland?

The center has no toilet ANYWHERE and very few rubbish bins. Is there a mayor in Dublin? Does she care about that? I've heard that people complain about drunks littering the place and causing chaos. To be honest I've never witnessed anything extreme, unless you call chaos a few loud noises at night. And as for littering, well, put bins and toilets? Where am I supposed to pee? In the river?

Also, this vaccine passport business. Yeah, great idea, but why do we have to wait until August to travel cheap? Why don't you offer young people a way to either vaccinate faster or have a free test so we can fly too? My country Greece (which is neither really rich nor well run) already opened the platform for 18-29. Ireland is still at 45 ! They are pretty much making us pay A LOT if we want to fly abroad while older people can already !

Was Ireland always like that? A state that in surface is well-run, but if you look underneath, it is designed to assist the older generation and the wealthy enough to own property (houses, restaurants etc) and just milk whatever money the young people have?",2021-06-01,

When he points at the Irish person and also the price on the shelf, the cashier says, it's different for you.

Hell, the airlines even have different prices, and don't hide the fact, it's €100 for an Argentinian to fly from Buenos Aires to Salta, it's €200 for anyone not from Argentina.

Can you imagine if this was allowed here? Wow.

EDIT: Some other examples
1) I go to ask a cobbler how much to repair my shoes, with my local girlfriend, I am given a price. I return the next day to hand the shoes in, the price is no 40% greater, and she remembers me.
2) The cashier in my local shop, will scan peoples items, except mine, every second item she skips the scanner and types in a monetary amount for, I shit you not, €0.01 more per item. Every single time I call her out, she scans the item and it's a lower price, every single time.
3) When asking anybody in a shop, whilst infront of a price tag, how much does this cost? They will stop for a moment, check the price, stop for another moment and tell you a price higher than they just checked in front of you.",2015-03-25,

Ireland AND milk AND price,23uln2,One Year a Paddy: Reflections on Ireland from a Yank,ireland,151,0.86,"I moved from the USA to Ireland a little over a year ago and wanted to post some of my thoughts about the island.

* When I first moved over, I didn't know what to expect.  My family's not Irish, so I had no preconceived notions of hunting down long lost relatives or visiting a small ancestral cottage in Kerry.  I've found when I tell people I'm not of Irish descent, they almost always like me right away.    I guess this speaks to just how annoying many tourists must be.

* On that topic I have, surprisingly, had many people tell me about their family that moved to America, and got to experience just how boring it is hearing someone else's family history.

* The variation in accents is fascinating to me.  How could such a small place have such different ways of talking?  Whenever I would meet someone who's accent I hadn't heard before, say Cork or Carlow, I would always be dumbfounded and find them incomprehensible.

* A lot of people ask me if Irish people are really as big into drinking as the stereotype suggests.  The thing is that if you don't go to the pub, at least every once and a while, people will consider you weird.  I've always liked going out to drink, and don't find that people drink more necessarily, but that it's social protocol to go out to the pub.

* On that note, Guinness really is much different here than it is in the US.  I would rarely drink it before I moved here, but now won't drink anything else.

* The amount of litter is always amazing to me.  I understand that on a Saturday morning the sidewalk around a chipper is going to be a mess, but it goes beyond that.  People will throw trash anywhere.  The state of rivers in even a small town is evidence of how little people seem to care about making an otherwise picturesque place look like garbage.

* The meats and dairy products, specifically lamb, are something to be proud of.   I can't tell you how nice it is compared to what we have in America.  Milk too, and I come from a state that people brag about their milk.  I know it's getting better, but I've always found the dairy aisles funny for the sheer amount of cheddar and no other type of cheese.  I remember telling friends, ""You guys know  there's more than one type of cheese, right?""

* The people are great.  75% of them, anyways.  They'll take time out of their day to show you how to get somewhere and then say you should come by for tea.  Irish moms are the best.  When I first moved over I wondered why people honked so much, assuming people were very angry drivers.  It took me a while to figure out they were saying hello to a friend walking down the street.  25% of the people, though, are just gigantic assholes that wouldn't spit on you to put out a fire because they don't like your face and when they get drunk...

* Everyone knows EVERYONE.  I can't tell you how many times I've overheard two strangers have this conversation in a pub: ""Oh sure, your mom is my neighbor's cousin's barber.  Sure, I know about you.""

* There's something I have started to call ""Irish Time.""  Someone says meet you at 9 it means 9:15, someone tells you a couple of days it means a week, you need paperwork from the government and they say it will take a month or two then may God have mercy on your soul.

* The price of some things are astounding.  Car insurance is how much?  You have to pay to HAVE a TV?  I couldn't believe it.  Never take for granted, though, how great it is to only have to pay 50 euro to see a doctor without insurance.

* Hatred towards Travellers is shocking to me.  I know it's a controversial subject, but to me, it's embarrassing for all parties involved.

* Before I moved to Ireland I could count the number of times I went to church on my fingers.  Since moving here I've been to mass six or seven times, and I'm not even Catholic.   

* I think a lot of Irish people like to talk bad about their country.  They don't like it an want to move to Australia as soon as they get a chance.  They think that if you don't live in Dublin that life will be a nightmare.  I personally think that there is so much to be proud of.  It is a truly unique country with some of the best people you'd ever like to meet.",2014-04-24,

Ireland AND milk AND price,nxg988,Is Irish beef considered good in Ireland?,ireland,45,0.36,"I've been thinking about this for several years now. In my country we got our own domestic beef on sale in ordinary grocery store alongside Irish beef which is usually about half the price of the domestic ones.

Unsurprisingly the domestic stuff is widely considered better because of less antibiotics and stuff, along with the fact that people like supporting local production.

Anyway. In Ireland, is the domestic beef considered the ""better alternative""? Are there even imported stuff that's cheaper?

In short, how's the beef situation over there?

(While we're at it, is the situation regarding pork and chicken the same?)

Edit: fixed the misconception about the antibiotics line. The general consensus over here seem to be that Irish beef producers use more antibiotics than domestic. I got no numbers for Ireland, but that's still what the general population believe.

Edit: I also want to be clear that I mean ""fresh"" beef. Not frozen. However, chicken is often sold frozen here so if you have anything to add about chicken in Ireland, please take this into consideration.

Last edit: while I don't care much for downvotes I apparently need to clarify that I am not out to vilify the Irish meat industry or anything. Keep your national pride or whatever. I only made this post to get to know more about the whole situation, there are some apparent cultural differences here that I didn't know about before and I am grateful for anyone who spent their time to give their view on it.

I understand we are all in the same boat so not looking for a pitty party but I am sickened by this country and it’s leaders and the daylight robbery we are being subjected to. The prices keep going up and the pay can not match it, owning a house is pipe dream and renting forces the choice of not being able to fucking eat. There is no future for a young person here and escaping is the only option and that’s if you can even save up enough to. The streets are filled with more homeless and drug addicts (no prejudice) than ever before and getting worse literally by the day. People are being ripped of all hope and chances at a better life and it is expected of us young people to just shut up and get on with it because “every generation goes through the same thing”. No this is not a normal way of life and we shouldn’t be expected to just put up with this. The people in power could not give any less of a shit about living conditions, cost of living and simply believe they can do what they please because they continue to get away with it. I’m not going to lie I don’t have the solutions but I just want a fair chance of doing something with my life and this place ties your hands and just shovels shit down your throat and expects you to pay for it. How much worse could this country get and how long are we going to let them get away with it????

Ireland AND milk AND price,fa9jfn,Feeling ripped off.,ireland,117,0.9,"So I went to a certain deli in Co. Offaly as they had in the window a full Irish advertised for €6.99.

Firstly the praise. Fast service. The food was tasty, not small portions either.

The problem here is they sent the tea with no milk. There was no condiments at all on the table.

I asked for milk, salt, and red sauce. Which I recieved. The salt was a shaker not sachets, sauce was a bottle.

When I finished I went to pay fully expecting the advertised price. But they charged me €8.79.

I questioned why were they over charging me. Asked was the drink inclusive.  They confirmed tea/coffee is part of the €6.99

So again I asked where are you getting this €8.79 from. I was then told it is 79 cents to get milk for the tea. 50 cents for use of any condiments bottle.

I paid. Then told them I am going onto reddit to complain. (I actually told them I'm never coming back, but that's a less fun story.)


So was I ripped off, or was I just being entitled expecting these things to be free.

 Next, I went to the deli to get a sandwich made up, total disinterest from another staff member, no smile, no personality visible at all...... I felt an imposition on her morning. I made a cup of tea to avail of the sandwich and any hot drink for €7. 50. 

Lastly, we picked up 2 bottles of water that were labelled 2 for 4 euro and went to pay...... She's charging me €13.10. 
I questioned it and she insists the water is 2 for 5euro..... We check and there is nothing labelled 5 euro in the fridge but she insists.... So I said ""grand"". But still  I was being overcharged on my sandwich meal..... She is about to argue with me but then decides better of it and produced a random barcode and managed to reduce the price by 60c. 

No smile, no thanks, no apology for overcharging..... No personality, just boredom and disinterest.

Ireland AND milk AND price,zgeyky,Carolan's versus Bailey's Irish Cream,ireland,6,0.8,"I went in for some Bailey's a few weeks ago and they only had the two fairly large sizes, the price of which caused me concern. I therefore opted to experiment with a somewhat less expensive Carolan's, which I have found to be very good. However, it's difficult to compare without a true side-by-side. Therefore it occurred to me to consult the wisdom of a more experience crowd.

So, my question: What do the Irish think of Carolan's versus Bailey's?

Secondly, upon a recommendation (from r/CasualUK no less!) I tried a 50/50 Irish cream and milk and it was quite good. I wondered if I could get an ounce or two of Jameson's, which I find to have a hint of spice, to float on top of the thicker Irish cream. Or would the whiskey just mix in? I don't have any Jameson's to try. Any previously acquired scientific data appreciated.

Ireland AND milk AND price,xhrv7m,Cheap and Easy Meal Plans to ease costs,ireland,18,0.81,"I dont think its just me right now, but i certainly am starting to feel the pinch of rising costs. Every week im looking at trying to cut costs where I can. I rent in Dublin with my partner in a houseshare, saving for a mortgage. Im thankful that my rent isnt utterly extortionate at the moment but that may change we will see what my landlord gets up to in the next couple of months. 

I've done a couple of little changes that in my circumstances are feasible, such as stop buying coffee in work, hopping off the luas a couple of stops early for the lower fare and walking the rest of the way to work. The luas thing sounds utterly desperate i know, but it saves me about 20 quid a month but im getting more exercise in which im happy about. 

I also started using my revolut as a way to save a little more by using the vaults for my spare change which has been really handy getting some unexpected items but were needed badly. 

The food bill is the next think I looked at. And trying to cut down on that bill but not cut down nutrition wise either. What i have done is made meals plans and stick to them for breakfast lunch and dinner each week. I try keep it within a certain budget too. It doesnt always but i do tend to stick to it when i can. 

Mods im hoping this is allowed, i know there is a subreddit for cheap and healthy meals but it is definitely more American based and i figured it might help basing it with Irish prices. I want to share a meal plan and the cost of it to show people you can still eat well without spending a tonne of money on the food bill. I have included the total price in each calculation, obviously I have a lot left over such as porridge or frozen vegetables for example that I wouldn't totally use up that week. 

This is based for 2 people, 1 in the office 3 days a week 2 days at home, 1 in the office on shift work 4 days a week. I did my weekly shop between Dunnes and Lidl last week. Im fortunate that i have the option of both as well as other shops to pick from such as Aldi and Tesco if I need them. 

Breakfast: Porridge made with milk and a spoonful of jam and a banana.  (€4 between us, porridge not included as i got a 1.5kg bag free on my lidl plus app) 

Lunch: Ham, cheese and lettuce sandwich with homemade potato and leek soup (€8 between us)

Snacks: Apple, Orange, Plum (€1.50 between us depends on whats on offer)

Dinners for the week: 

Sunday: Roast chicken thighs, frozen veg, baby potatoes (€4.50)

Monday: Left over chicken and vegetables cooked with condensed cream of mushroom soup served with rice (€3.35, chicken and vegetables included in Sundays price)

Tuesday:  Green and Red Dahl made with chopped tomatoes, vegetables and coconut milk served with rice (€4.50, spices not included as already had cumin, chilli, garlic, ginger and turmeric to hand, cost of rice included in Monday's recipe)

Wednesday: Pasta with green pesto and cheese (€2.50, cost of cheese included in lunch price) 

Thursday: Left over from Tuesday's Dahl

Friday: Fish Finger and veggie pie topped with a mustard cheesy mash (€2.60, price of cheese included in lunch, mustard was already to hand but afaik the jar cost me 59cent in lidl)

Saturday is usually a takeout to treat ourselves. 

In total this shop came to €31 between the two of us and I still have frozen veg, porridge, rice, jam lentils left over for another week.  We did have to pop out and get more bread by the end of the week as the one we had started to turn, but that is to be expected. Sometimes i might have a money off voucher for Dunnes or Lidl will have something i need on offer in their app or something for free like that porridge, that helps me save a lot as well. 

I try change it up week to week and it goes by what's on offer. We have cut back on meat a good bit lately but if we are buying meat we make sure the meat we get we can stretch out like chicken thighs, pork lion or mince. 

Just thought this might give some people an idea of cutting back on the food bill and still make really nice food. Im more than happy to share some of my cheap and cheerful meals if anyone wants them. If anyone has any of their own I'd love to hear them.",2022-09-18,

I flew into Belfast at around 12:30 - got to passport control and your man scaning my passport was like ""jesus must be a shock getting off the plane into this friggin weather - but welcome home!""

We drove home, stopping off for food in the pub near my house as there was no food at home - pub staff, who I don't even really know asked how was the holiday, talked for a little bit about it, and said we looked like we needed a seat by the fire, so we got one.  

Then went to Centra to get milk as I wasn't sure what was in the house - the girl in Centra asked how I've been and was I away, I don't even know her name...  

When we got home finally - the neighbours called over with mince pies they baked and a bottle of mulled wine. I'm off the booze so the bf took that one with him, but the mince pies were scoffed.  

I love Ireland. I know I give it shit sometimes but really you would not get friendlier people in the world. I had a similar experience when I came back from 6 months working in the states.

Ireland AND milk AND price,a46y77,The Blú Vest Movement Research...let's have a conversation,ireland,41,0.41,"
**The Buí Vest Movement**
 
(Buí is irish for yellow)

  
*Summary*


'When' is a difficult question because I don't have a crystal ball (!) but 'how' I could research a little and maybe someone else can take the torch from here. 

-

 **HOW DO WE START A YELLOW VEST MOVEMENT IN IRELAND**



 **First the source of the YV**

&gt;Although the citizen 'Yellow Vest' movement — called so because of the high visibility jackets French motorists have to carry in their cars — started over high fuel prices, it has since mutated into a crisis about spending power and inequalities.
https://www.euronews.com/amp/2018/12/07/yellow-vests-what-s-driving-the-anger

 **Summary of them**

So it's driven by one group like the French motorists in this case. They felt they had justification at the vicious rise in fuel prices, **a all encompassing reason** 
Anyone who drives will tell you that even 10% hike is massive never mind what they were going to endure. A climbdown has since happened but only for 6 months. 

 **Conclusion on yellow vest**


So it's need to be massive group with a very clear objective. What we would need is a similar effect from a middle class group, I'm guessing. 

 **Questionable groups I would 'personally' would rule out because of size of appeal**
 

The groups here like trade unions involved in disputes, farmers , bus drivers etc. 


Small businesses getting taxed or omitted from budgets cuts .

The homeless Raise the roof 

The political groups like PBP, etc etc, all in the Dail with a seat and pension etc

  **Reason I'd rule them out:**


I could never see any of them grabbing a large mass of people like you or your family members getting stung with high fuel prices , they don't have a big enough cause , in my very humble opinion. I love the IFA and their proactive 'sheep firing around the Dail gates' (!) but they are not getting that traction unless their CAP type funding of milk quota was pulled. I just couldn't see everyone beeping their horns at them but perhaps I'm wrong 


 **Potential Cause**


Here's one that's starting to maybe grow a little that 'might' migrate into the yellow vest in France, it's the environment. 

&gt;In his editorial, Dion writes that the struggle for economic and social equality cannot be disconnected from the fight for environmental justice: “Let us show that we French people are capable of rising en masse for things greater than ourselves,” he implored. “The revolutionaries of 1789 rose up against the price of bread, the famine, and inequalities. But they did not stop there. They created the rights of man and citizen. You rose up because of fuel and against taxes. Together, let’s create a society where the survival of all is more important than the profits of a few.”
https://qz.com/1486158/can-frances-yellow-vests-go-green-one-activist-thinks-so/amp/


 **Overall Conclusion on environment movement**


This may sound ageist but the kids today are just better at understanding the absolute havoc we are doing to our earth, they care far more than maybe we did or were required too...Captain Planet was about all that got our eyebrows raised!. 

They are seeing further , perhaps hundreds of years ahead and want change badly. In those hands we might see 'the buí vest' being pulled on. 


PLEASE NOTE: This is for people who want to research this or have a conversation. I wrote this because I'm curious how we could start one because i don't see a better society , just a richer one for a few. I would like cheaper places to live in and better prices for things ...and our governments don't seem to want this as much as I do. Maybe we can at least say we tried

I asked for one this morning in a Dublin City Centre Starbucks and the barista looked at his screen and exclaimed surprise that the “Short Cappuchino” was actually in the system. It cost Eur 2.55 (see receipt) which is 0.35c cheaper than the normally cheapest “Tall” option priced at EUR 2.90.

Our climate and relative lack of population density means that our cattle and sheep are out grazing in the greenest of grass for most of the year, but in most places, industrial farming puts animals indoors being fed processed leftover byproducts as much as anything else and christ you taste the difference.

So yeah, nothing massive, just be a little thankful that nobody ever talks about grass fed beef on our little isle because the most efficient way for us to produce meat also means they're not trapped in massive industrial sheds all day long, pumped full of whatever maximises the speed of journey from birth to plate.

Ireland AND dairy AND quality,yioxfk,Is it truly unaffordable for lower-income families to eat healthi?,ireland,167,0.68,"Very often I read that obesity is rife among low-income families because they can’t afford to buy fresh, good-quality ingredients and thus resort to ‘top-shelf products’ like pot noodles, which are €1 each. I’m slightly sceptical of this view. One of my favourite meals is courgettes &amp; bacon with spaghetti. When I add up how much this costs for 4 people this is how it works out: €1.19 for two courgettes (500g), 125g bacon (€1), onion (25c), olive oil (10c from big bottle), 400g spaghetti (€1.50), 4 eggs (€1.20) and some Parmesan (30c from packet). So this amounts to €5.50 overall or €1.40 per person for a family of 4 -  not much more than the €1 pot noodles but much more nutritious and filling. And not particularly time-consuming.

There are so many other meals that can be made cheaply on a strict budget - videos on Youtube show how to make things like curry for under $10 for example (these videos are mainly produced by Americans but use ingredients widely available in Ireland). 

This all leads me to believe that ignorance/lack of time/laziness are more to blame for obesity than lack of money. I don’t think ‘inability to cook’ is really an excuse - basically anyone can learn how to cook a decent meal from YouTube tutorials or from other sources online. Furthermore, the quality of produce in Ireland is second to none (consider the dairy and meat for example), so if people do decide to cook their own meals they’ll be highly nutritious (unlike in the US where he quality of meat an be poor).

No surprise here, but everything just seems to be getting worse. I know you're all excited about Kerrygold being exported all over the world, but at what cost? The rush to dairy, among other things, has meant our waterways are becoming more and more polluted.

As you can see from the graph in the diagram, human waste is also a factor in waterway quality with agriculture being miles in front as the worst polluters.

We have the least tree coverage in Europe bar Malta, which is a speck in the Med, and are undergoing a biodiversity crisis. Air pollution is getting worse.

The comments are the usual morons talking about India and China. I didn't realise India and China are polluting our air and waterways! We also have a much higher footprint than both of these countries, and it's rich countries like Ireland who are buying the rubbish from dirty factories in China. China, who I believe will be world leaders in green tech sooner or later.

Roses : a classic but don't think they have aged well. Almost sickly sweet.

Celebrations : great on paper but it gets old fairly fast. Promotes small versions of the bars but the nicest is the malteaser one designed just for the tins.

Cadbury Heros : I think these would be the new king if they dumped that creme egg one. In reality is just loads of Cadbury chocolate which is in no way a bad thing. Imagine a malteasers truffle like one but with crunchie instead. 


All ""tins"" need to increase their size or amount.

But just take a minute to look up mtCO2eq from transport in ireland then compare it to agriculture. Now factor in that this figure is not honest. The figure for agricultural doesn't include imported feed or fertiliser, among other things. If all was accounted for then the real figure could be half as big again. 

I'll get downvoted guaranteed because any mention of veganism always gets hate on here. Being realistic if you want to make a significant change to your carbon footprint you should really consider cutting out meat and dairy.

It's not just carbon either, the amount of water used to produce feed for agricultural animals is ludicrous. 

I'm not trying to talk down to anyone, most of us have been raised with the mindset that eating meat and dairy is healthy and there was never any talk of its impact on the environment until a few years back. It's difficult to think about all the damage that has been done but it's never too late to change. I went vegetarian in my early 30s and went vegan a few years after. You just need to ignore the hate that you might get from people about your 'notions' became they probably don't know what they're talking about and are afraid to confront themselves about what they've been doing their whole lives. 

If you haven't looked into it I urge you to please have a look at some research papers if you can access them or maybe watch a documentary or read a book on it. 

I'm also not saying you're a bad person if you don't go 100% vegan immediately (because I know a lot tout this idea). Try it out once a week, then maybe a few days a week. Maybe you'll end up liking it more than you thought. There's more vegan products being released all the time these days so it's easier than ever.

Ireland AND dairy AND grass,p10ls6,"Misleading terminology: ""carbon sink""",ireland,25,0.8,"Almost every time I see reference to a ""carbon sink"" in non-scientific publications or journalism, it seems to be presented as something that makes CO2 disappear from the atmosphere. This is true only if its mass is increasing.

""Carbon sinks"" basically represent carbon that's already been sunk. If you take water out of the equation, plants and trees are mostly carbon. Soil is only something for them to grow in, it's not what they're made of. Plants and animals take carbon out of the air and turn it into cells: we are carbon-based lifeforms.

Usually those carbon atoms are attached to water molecules. If you break that attachment you get energy. This is why dead plants make good food (CARBOhydrates) and good fuel (hydroCARBONs.)

Wood burns well if you leave it dry out, bogs burn well if you dry them out, and petrochemicals (which form if some carbon sink is brought underground by geological processes and allowed decompose very, very slowly for at least a few ten thousands of years.) Whether you burn them or eat them, that carbon is set free again.

(Those sinks can include massive accumulations of animals (usually plankton,) but their decay takes even longer still.)

The Farmer's Journal will say that a lovely green field is a carbon sink, which it is...while grass is growing. As soon as that grass is cut and turned into hay which will feed the dairy industry the sink has been emptied. All that carbon will be put back into the atmosphere. An absolutely inconsequential amount of carbon ends up ""sequestered"" in the soil of a pasture.

It's not even antiintellectualism, it's doublespeak and propaganda - **""emissions"" and ""rising CO2 levels"" can be understood by anyone as a mass balance equation**: there is too much carbon in the atmosphere, plants take that atmospheric carbon and lock it away. There's no need to think about concentrations or PPMs: the weight of carbon in the plant matter you grow must equal the weight of atmospheric carbon we need to remove. These are both things you can measure in kilograms. It isn't rocket science. Don't cut bogs, don't plant to harvest, grow forests rather than plantations. If you see this framed as hippy bullshit, you are being deceived. Notice which publications or advocacy groups or people have been seen to deceive, in any direction, and stop trusting them FFS.",2021-08-09,

Ireland AND dairy AND grass,sinh85,All this discussion about emissions from transport sector and carbon tax on fuel is great but that's not even half the picture.,ireland,21,0.59,"First off we definitely need to do reduce emissions from transport. This post is in no way arguing against that.

But just take a minute to look up mtCO2eq from transport in ireland then compare it to agriculture. Now factor in that this figure is not honest. The figure for agricultural doesn't include imported feed or fertiliser, among other things. If all was accounted for then the real figure could be half as big again. 

I'll get downvoted guaranteed because any mention of veganism always gets hate on here. Being realistic if you want to make a significant change to your carbon footprint you should really consider cutting out meat and dairy.

It's not just carbon either, the amount of water used to produce feed for agricultural animals is ludicrous. 

I'm not trying to talk down to anyone, most of us have been raised with the mindset that eating meat and dairy is healthy and there was never any talk of its impact on the environment until a few years back. It's difficult to think about all the damage that has been done but it's never too late to change. I went vegetarian in my early 30s and went vegan a few years after. You just need to ignore the hate that you might get from people about your 'notions' became they probably don't know what they're talking about and are afraid to confront themselves about what they've been doing their whole lives. 

If you haven't looked into it I urge you to please have a look at some research papers if you can access them or maybe watch a documentary or read a book on it. 

I'm also not saying you're a bad person if you don't go 100% vegan immediately (because I know a lot tout this idea). Try it out once a week, then maybe a few days a week. Maybe you'll end up liking it more than you thought. There's more vegan products being released all the time these days so it's easier than ever. If people are interested in swapping over but are concerned about nutrition I can make a quick document about what you need and where you can get it in irish shops.

Ireland AND dairy AND farmers,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.78,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

We've read up on the visa/work/naturalization process and it seems fairly easy for us (coming from the U.S.A.) to move to Ireland. He has a wonderful career in clinical healthcare/healthcare administration, and I have experience in horticulture, teaching, and caregiving. Our expenses our low, the area we live in is safe, but the satisfaction of life leaves something to be desired. Currently we are apathetic to the U.S.A. at best and despise it at worst. It's not the kind of culture we would like to raise future children in (or live in ourselves.) We anticipate a move to a northern state in the U.S.A. (we live in the south) next year, but after that happens, we keep coming back to Ireland as a possibility. My great-great-grandparents came over to America from Ireland, but now I'd like to get the hell out. 

We are about 45% sure at this moment that we want to drop everything we know and start a dairy farm in Ireland. We only expect this percentage to increase as time goes on.

2. What cities or locations would be best suited for us?

Ireland AND dairy AND farmers,ep8f7i,2000 Kilometers around Ireland - A great journey &amp; my thoughts,ireland,22,0.89,"Dear irish people and ireland lovers,

in September 2019 i sat myself in the plane to Dublin, rented a car and started to explore the island for 7 days without pretty much research about famous sights and things. This might be sound strange in the 21st century with Phones´n Apps´n Net, but it´s way more fun to figure out what people and locals tell you on the road.. or sometimes unfortunately not. Of course, completly without phone is unconvenient. Especially with maps, airbnb and food spots. But making plans on the road works pretty fine for me for some years already and meeting and hanging out with local people is the best.

The trip started immediately incredibly good.. Jeez, irish people are so welcoming, heartwarming and nice, that i felt very cozy on that small and sometimes creepy roads and cottages. I thought, it might be war on those tiny roads, but they´re all so polite drivers and i swear, in 2k Kilometers i only freaked out 1 or 2 times, while furious road rage and shouting at people is a speciality in germany, where i´m from, btw. Almost everyone is greeting or waving at you (in a friendly way) and if there´s a question about anything, well.. Don´t dare to ask. It seemed like i found the goldpot on the end of the rainbow before i even slid it down and high fived the goblin... Already on day No.1!

I met incredibly nice characters, of all facettes and ages that i´m feeling like a fanboy telling all my friends that i was in ireland and compare each country now with ireland like i´m Howard Wollowitz who came lately from space. There was Phil the dairy farmer or Brigid the shepherd.. and so many more. Those 7 days was actually a constant hussle. Everyday booking and finding a new airbnb (which wasn´t that cheap btw), doing the new route, recording vlogs.. But it doesn´t felt like it was stressful. I enjoyed almost every minute with all the people i met and the perfect nature i saw. For sure, i´m very focused on meeting people and wanna see how they live and learn about their culture. That´s why i drove 95% countryroads, visiting each little village where sometimes the center was only one house with some dogs. But it´s time consuming. For 250Km way by car, you´re on the track for 3-4h. And this brings me to the most important point: Time management. I think i did the best with the time i had. In 7 days i had like 2 very rainy and one slight rainy day. The 2 bad ones i used to stick more on the road and approach the west of the island earlier (which was a very nice move, turned out later) and that other day i was really mad, because it destroyed my experience in Galway, which i skipped after being bloody wet. But all in all i was lucky and got accostumed to wind and quick weather changes pretty fast. Sometimes i still have this fine sea breeze in my nose.. Which i like so damn much. Anyway. The car gives such an huge advantage, especially when it comes to the airbnbs, which was -in my case- everytime located in the deepest countryside and yes.. The first and second approach to my cozy beds led me through mysterious and ancient roads, covered by green and ol´ rocks while the sun was almost gone. But everytime a host opened the door, it felt like home. Jeez.. How i miss salty irish butter and some fresh cones.

The only thing on the downside: It´s pricey. Don´t get me wrong, it´s nice and all and of course people need to live. But sometimes it was a bit outrageous here and there when it came to groceries or eating in pub/restaurant. Though on the upside the meals are very big i´ve to admit. But transport, fuel etc. is expensive. I paid for a 5min ferry ride like 20€. One way. The flight from germany though is a joke and.. I don´t know how to say it, but cmon. 60€ Two way ticket?! The filling of water of the toilets in the plane are even more expensive. I don´t wanna talk about economics (which i did in the middle of nowhere in a lonely rock desert in my favorite area ""Achill Islands"" with a stranger) but this cheap flying is curse and blessing big time. I talked with a shepherd about it and he said, a ride with the train from the Dingle Area to Dublin is more expensive. Freaky times.

All in all this road trip was one of my favorite trips so far and i just can recommend to everyone to go there while it´s off season and all the majority of tourists are gone. I had so many many places almost for me alone.. It felt like i´ve chosen the perfect time to go there. No super packed places, no queues, no overloaded roads.

As i mentioned it above, i do simple vlogs with an action cam, not money orientated, i make a living with a regular job like everyone else and just use it as a diary, while i travel most of the time alone and sometimes with my girlfriend. I still upload weekly storys since September from Ireland with all the people i met there and i invite you besides this ""little"" roman here to come over and have a watch while you´re at dinner or something. My favorite one so far is the experience with the lovely shepherd lady. [https://www.youtube.com/danabroad](https://www.youtube.com/danabroad)

Thanks a lot to the irish people for being so kind! This sounds very sentimental, but most of you please stay as you´re in a constantly changing world!

Ireland AND dairy AND farmers,p10ls6,"Misleading terminology: ""carbon sink""",ireland,25,0.79,"Almost every time I see reference to a ""carbon sink"" in non-scientific publications or journalism, it seems to be presented as something that makes CO2 disappear from the atmosphere. This is true only if its mass is increasing.

""Carbon sinks"" basically represent carbon that's already been sunk. If you take water out of the equation, plants and trees are mostly carbon. Soil is only something for them to grow in, it's not what they're made of. Plants and animals take carbon out of the air and turn it into cells: we are carbon-based lifeforms.

Usually those carbon atoms are attached to water molecules. If you break that attachment you get energy. This is why dead plants make good food (CARBOhydrates) and good fuel (hydroCARBONs.)

Wood burns well if you leave it dry out, bogs burn well if you dry them out, and petrochemicals (which form if some carbon sink is brought underground by geological processes and allowed decompose very, very slowly for at least a few ten thousands of years.) Whether you burn them or eat them, that carbon is set free again.

(Those sinks can include massive accumulations of animals (usually plankton,) but their decay takes even longer still.)

The Farmer's Journal will say that a lovely green field is a carbon sink, which it is...while grass is growing. As soon as that grass is cut and turned into hay which will feed the dairy industry the sink has been emptied. All that carbon will be put back into the atmosphere. An absolutely inconsequential amount of carbon ends up ""sequestered"" in the soil of a pasture.

It's not even antiintellectualism, it's doublespeak and propaganda - **""emissions"" and ""rising CO2 levels"" can be understood by anyone as a mass balance equation**: there is too much carbon in the atmosphere, plants take that atmospheric carbon and lock it away. There's no need to think about concentrations or PPMs: the weight of carbon in the plant matter you grow must equal the weight of atmospheric carbon we need to remove. These are both things you can measure in kilograms. It isn't rocket science. Don't cut bogs, don't plant to harvest, grow forests rather than plantations. If you see this framed as hippy bullshit, you are being deceived. Notice which publications or advocacy groups or people have been seen to deceive, in any direction, and stop trusting them FFS.",2021-08-09,

I'd be really interested to hear Irish people's view on lessening animal based farming in the pursuit of societal progress (less food/water waste, better for the environment, better for animal suffering - amongst others)

I'm aware that many livelihoods in Ireland revolve around farming animals, but if lessening that brings benefits to society and future generations then surely that's not something to turn your nose up to?

Ireland AND dairy AND farmers,xc90tp,New Policies By The Leprechaun Council Part 1,ireland,7,0.25,"Disclaimer: The following is a sarcastic take on the way people are getting fleeced in the country. The content of this article should not be taken as a professional recommendation by any unprofessional politicians who are running this place to the ground. If they do implement these as laws, please don't blame me... 


The grand council of Leprechauns has identified that the current issues faced by the people of Ireland stem from four main elements. 

1. A lack of housing 

2. The inflation in the market 

3. Lack of infrastructure (public transportation, energy production, schools , hospitals  , a functional airport or roads without potholes) 

4. Lack of money that is available to spend on the above. 

In order to combat these issues , we have devised a series of measures that should solve these problems. 

1.  A Graveyard Tax: 

It has come to our attention that alot of prime real estate is being taken up by the graves of people who are dead. Every individual is taking up a space of almost 20 square foot of space in a grave site. That's more space than a typical student accommodation! 

At this rate, we will have most of the land taken over by graveyards within a few centuries. So we hereby propose that every individual who wants to have a graveyard of the standard size , establish a trust fund that will pay a graveyard tax to the government in perpetuity. The fund needs to take into consideration the inflation trend and account for a 20% increase in estimated costs every year the graveyard will be occupied. Should your fund run out or you become delinquent in the payment, then the corpse will be exhumed and processed into bone meal for the gardens of the tech companies who are keeping the country afloat. 

For those who don't have the facility to pay said graveyard tax, you will have the option of a viking burial ( toss your corpse out on the ocean on a plyboard and light it up). This option will be subject to a carbon tax , depending on how much smoke you emit as your corpse burns. However, in the current market rend , we are sure you would have withered down to your bones due to the cost of living and hence your carbon tax would probably be covered by your pension fund. 

Another alternative for those who want to ensure their loved ones have a place to visit, is the tower of eternal slumber. This will be a multistory tower where each deceased individual will be intered in a block sized coffin and it will be arranged like Jenga blocks to ensure maximum space efficiencty. Our biggest sponsor , Demazon has offered to provide their expertise in warehouse management to help us build this structure. This however comes with a rental cost and if your loved ones are unable to pay the rent then your remains will become the property of Demazon to use as they see fit { Message from our sponsor: Demazon is now offering Fertilizer, pet food and calcium supplements at exciting prices }

If you have no money whatsoever and your loved ones are already burdened with the struggles of day to day living, then you have the exciting opportunity to volunteer yourself as a lab test subject to any of our pharmaceutical partners. This option will allow you to do your part for the future of humanity and the company would happily provide you with a vertical grave as a permanent resting place. Recent studies have shown the benefits of standing rather than sitting or sleeping. So these firms will offer you an ergonomically vertical graveyard after they have used your body for their nefarious purposes. 

2. Tax On Unauthorized Expulsion Of Gaseous Waste ( Fart /burp tax) 

Our minister for purple energy has identified that emissions of methane in all forms is a significant contributor to global warming. While the current measures are already working on taxing the farmers to their bones and making them take a shotgun to their cattle; we need to expand our carbon tax further. 

Henceforth, every individual would be expected to pay a fart tax along with their PRSI , USC , TV Tax, VAT  and the arbitrary taxes we come up with , promise to remove after a while but never do. The fart tax would be paid based on an estimated emission of fart based on your age , size , dietary pattern and dairy consumption. You will ofcourse have to do most of the work in calculating these and entering relevant information in our revenue website. At the end of the year, you will have to submit notarized affadavits to claim any fart free periods. When you purchase beans , dairy or other items that have been linked to causing said emissions, you will be taxed additionally at the checkout counter. Restaurants serving foods that cause flatulence will have the option of levying the tax on your bill. 

We will be conducting random assessment on your gaseous emission to ensure you are within your limits. An inspector will follow you around with a fart meter behind you and will give an assessment on your emmision level. 

Alternatively, you can install a smart fart meter on your rear that would directly link your emmision to our system. 


The tax will have provision to further expand into a breathing tax which is currently being researched. It has come to our attention that individuals who breathe are causing more expenses than those who don't for the government. Hence we will soon be expanding this tax to incentivize people to stop breathing. Remember,these taxes are a measure to incentivize positive behavior, not make money off you...

USA AND milk AND price,23uln2,One Year a Paddy: Reflections on Ireland from a Yank,ireland,151,0.86,"I moved from the USA to Ireland a little over a year ago and wanted to post some of my thoughts about the island.

* When I first moved over, I didn't know what to expect.  My family's not Irish, so I had no preconceived notions of hunting down long lost relatives or visiting a small ancestral cottage in Kerry.  I've found when I tell people I'm not of Irish descent, they almost always like me right away.    I guess this speaks to just how annoying many tourists must be.

* On that topic I have, surprisingly, had many people tell me about their family that moved to America, and got to experience just how boring it is hearing someone else's family history.

* The variation in accents is fascinating to me.  How could such a small place have such different ways of talking?  Whenever I would meet someone who's accent I hadn't heard before, say Cork or Carlow, I would always be dumbfounded and find them incomprehensible.

* A lot of people ask me if Irish people are really as big into drinking as the stereotype suggests.  The thing is that if you don't go to the pub, at least every once and a while, people will consider you weird.  I've always liked going out to drink, and don't find that people drink more necessarily, but that it's social protocol to go out to the pub.

* On that note, Guinness really is much different here than it is in the US.  I would rarely drink it before I moved here, but now won't drink anything else.

* The amount of litter is always amazing to me.  I understand that on a Saturday morning the sidewalk around a chipper is going to be a mess, but it goes beyond that.  People will throw trash anywhere.  The state of rivers in even a small town is evidence of how little people seem to care about making an otherwise picturesque place look like garbage.

* The meats and dairy products, specifically lamb, are something to be proud of.   I can't tell you how nice it is compared to what we have in America.  Milk too, and I come from a state that people brag about their milk.  I know it's getting better, but I've always found the dairy aisles funny for the sheer amount of cheddar and no other type of cheese.  I remember telling friends, ""You guys know  there's more than one type of cheese, right?""

* The people are great.  75% of them, anyways.  They'll take time out of their day to show you how to get somewhere and then say you should come by for tea.  Irish moms are the best.  When I first moved over I wondered why people honked so much, assuming people were very angry drivers.  It took me a while to figure out they were saying hello to a friend walking down the street.  25% of the people, though, are just gigantic assholes that wouldn't spit on you to put out a fire because they don't like your face and when they get drunk...

* Everyone knows EVERYONE.  I can't tell you how many times I've overheard two strangers have this conversation in a pub: ""Oh sure, your mom is my neighbor's cousin's barber.  Sure, I know about you.""

* There's something I have started to call ""Irish Time.""  Someone says meet you at 9 it means 9:15, someone tells you a couple of days it means a week, you need paperwork from the government and they say it will take a month or two then may God have mercy on your soul.

* The price of some things are astounding.  Car insurance is how much?  You have to pay to HAVE a TV?  I couldn't believe it.  Never take for granted, though, how great it is to only have to pay 50 euro to see a doctor without insurance.

* Hatred towards Travellers is shocking to me.  I know it's a controversial subject, but to me, it's embarrassing for all parties involved.

* Before I moved to Ireland I could count the number of times I went to church on my fingers.  Since moving here I've been to mass six or seven times, and I'm not even Catholic.   

* I think a lot of Irish people like to talk bad about their country.  They don't like it an want to move to Australia as soon as they get a chance.  They think that if you don't live in Dublin that life will be a nightmare.  I personally think that there is so much to be proud of.  It is a truly unique country with some of the best people you'd ever like to meet.",2014-04-24,

He voted to Remain…but now *""wishes he'd voted to Leave""!* For him it's morphed into ""bigger issues of national sovereignty &amp; immigration"". He thinks Merkel letting a million refugees into the reich was madness. 

David knows about GFA &amp; thorny NI aspects of Brexit, but isn't too worried about the Irish angle. Explained I regularly traveled over Border in 90s when it  looked like iron curtain. But thats all gone &amp; we'd really like it to *stay that way*. I outlined via e.g. Dairy Co-Ops that trade is so integrated, post-hard-Brexit UK will be hit hard. Forget about IRE, why shoot *yourselves* in the foot? Even May now acknowledges EU regs will stay in place re drug supply/banking/food etc. 

**David *knows* UK will take an economic blow from Brexit.** However he thinks **it's worth it to allow 'more control' over who comes into the place.** 

I politely observed even the 'best case' scenario, i.e. Norwegian model, will do four fifths of fuck all on that front.  Might even perversely increase undocumented UK immigration. As UK then hasn't much recourse, French could actively push through unfortunate Calais crew. And as per Brit gov promises, anybody will still be able to access^ahem ..'mainland' GB via scary Eire. 

David wasn't very concerned. He asked if living in US had impacted my take on Brexit. Replied I'm daily seeing the **unintended consequences of populism.** Convo was very civil yet hair pullingly frustrating.

God help Ireland.. this is shaping up to be some clusterfuck.

dairy AND subsidies,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.74,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

We would usually grab some lunch but have mostly stopped this due to the price increases and cheap ingredients a lot of places have switched to, but we would always grab a take out coffee for our walk around. 

We went in Saturday for the first time in a few weeks and I ordered our usual two coffee and hers with Oat milk as she is lactose intolerant and can’t drink dairy. 

Wasn’t paying too much attention as I was chatting with the girl at the counter so just tapped my phone and then noticed the price was 10.20. I looked at the menu and sure enough the coffees had gone up to 4.50 each so I asked about the extra 1.20 thinking I was overcharged. 

Girl told me no, they had a VAT increase recently and all prices went up and the milk went from 50cent to 1.20€. 

Checked back on my payments are last time we went (about 6 weeks ago) I paid 8.50 and now it’s 10.20. 

Told your one I thought 10.20 was scandalous for two coffees and she said that a few people had mentioned it, but didn’t want to start anything big with a minimum wage employee who has no control over prices. 

I work from home so tend to drink coffee at home during the week, so Saturday in town was probably the only one I’d get out and I enjoyed supporting a local business but fuck me there seems to be a right level of greed in some Irish business right now and charging 1.20 for a milk substitute for someone who actually needs it is terrible.

* Return train to Dublin: €43 - 83 (can be €28 for a 3 hr bus journey)
* Hotel accommodation in Dublin (Cheapest twin room in city centre 2 nights): 140PP
* Drinks: €5 avg per pint (€50 avg per day)
* Food: Breakfast €10 Lunch €15 dinner € 20 (45€ avg per day)

Alternatives:

* Return flight to Gdasnk: €39

* Price of a pint: €2.20 (€22 avg per day)
* Food: Avg meal in a cheap restaurant, according to numbeo: €5.70 (€20 avg per day)

**Total PP: €146 (Went for nicer accomodation)**

Firstly the praise. Fast service. The food was tasty, not small portions either.

The problem here is they sent the tea with no milk. There was no condiments at all on the table.

I asked for milk, salt, and red sauce. Which I recieved. The salt was a shaker not sachets, sauce was a bottle.

When I finished I went to pay fully expecting the advertised price. But they charged me €8.79.

I questioned why were they over charging me. Asked was the drink inclusive.  They confirmed tea/coffee is part of the €6.99

So again I asked where are you getting this €8.79 from. I was then told it is 79 cents to get milk for the tea. 50 cents for use of any condiments bottle.

I paid. Then told them I am going onto reddit to complain. (I actually told them I'm never coming back, but that's a less fun story.)

When he points at the Irish person and also the price on the shelf, the cashier says, it's different for you.

I lived in South America for 4 years, this is not just something that happens from time to time, it is given for any transaction that you will be treated differently than a local. It's just how things work. Every. Single. Time.

I love my kittens so much! They have brought me immeasurable joy. When they run to me in the morning, I feel my sadness lift.

However, when I first got my cats, I spent a silly amount of money buying expensive things from the pet store. I also bought a lot of unnecessary things. After 3+ months with my cats, I have compiled a list of things that I actually use for my cats. I also have the revelation that cats don’t care for price, so I might as well buy on the cheap.

This is my to buy list with links. I have no affiliation to any business or anything. I just want to share the cat love. 

I also made a series of important pointers that I wish that I knew at the beginning

Important Things That I Wish I knew

1. I have to scoop our tray every day and completely change litter every couple of days. Clumping litter is handy

2. My cats sometimes wake me up in the middle of the night 

3. Kittens need to be fed 3 times per day and cats need to be fed 2 times per day 

4. Kittens are happy to stay alone for a few hours per day. Cats can stay alone for a day 

5. Cats cannot drink milk. They need a special type of milk. My cats drink water

6. Cats need to be vaccinated/dewormed/check-up every year. You can join a vet plan for €20 per month. This will cover all your routine visits. However, it will not cover any emergency visits. Also, your insurance is dependent on you having regular check-ups with a vet 

7. Cats get sick for all sorts of reasons. Cats don’t always land on their feet. If your cat swallows an object. It can cost you anywhere north of €1,000 to save fluffy. Insurance is so important. I got it for €10.00 per month

8. Timed-release feeders are not always reliable

9. Cats can be messy. My kittens toss their food and litter all over the floor. Enclosed litter trays were an excellent solution 

10. Cats get lonely if they are on their own for too long. A second cat can be a great option if feasible 

11. It costs €20 to register your microchip. It is covered by the €20 p/m vet fee. It is essential because if your pet wanders (which they will, any vet can scan it and find out the owners and contact details)",2022-08-23,
milk AND price,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.76,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

milk AND price,nq1h8g,Controversial (?) opinion on Dublin from a foreigner living in Ireland for the last 7 months,ireland,178,0.89,"I came in Ireland in October, originally to study (a phd, i am 25, long story, dropped out, now working remote).

I was kind of enthusiastic because it was one of my top choices around Europe : friendly people, English language, Ryanair flying you cheap everywhere, walkable city.

All these proved true.

I like how easily I can walk around most of Dublin's center, how good the public transport is, how friendly the people are usually.

But I came to realize that at my view, Ireland is run in a horrible way from a young person's POV. The best way to describe it is that they treat young people as pretty much ""not my business"".

The rents situation is insane and from all the people I've spoken with, there is not a single politician willing to do something for the issue.

It is not normal to need to share a house with strangers because if I want to rent alone, rent would cost almost 70% of my salary.It is not normal to see other young people having to share a room (!) because of the extreme prices.It looks like the Irish politicians don't care about that, that they want to shape the housing market for the owners, who are usually 40-50 years old people, and completely ignore the younger people.

Sinn Fien is - from what I've understood - the only ones that support changes in the system, but these changes are mostly directed towards the very poor of the society. Which is great, and 100% needed, but I don't see them representing the interests of the younger generation either. Am I wrong? Have they suggested ways to make living alone affordable for young people? Has ANY political party in Ireland?

The center has no toilet ANYWHERE and very few rubbish bins. Is there a mayor in Dublin? Does she care about that? I've heard that people complain about drunks littering the place and causing chaos. To be honest I've never witnessed anything extreme, unless you call chaos a few loud noises at night. And as for littering, well, put bins and toilets? Where am I supposed to pee? In the river?

Also, this vaccine passport business. Yeah, great idea, but why do we have to wait until August to travel cheap? Why don't you offer young people a way to either vaccinate faster or have a free test so we can fly too? My country Greece (which is neither really rich nor well run) already opened the platform for 18-29. Ireland is still at 45 ! They are pretty much making us pay A LOT if we want to fly abroad while older people can already !

Was Ireland always like that? A state that in surface is well-run, but if you look underneath, it is designed to assist the older generation and the wealthy enough to own property (houses, restaurants etc) and just milk whatever money the young people have?",2021-06-01,

milk AND price,zgeyky,Carolan's versus Bailey's Irish Cream,ireland,6,0.67,"I went in for some Bailey's a few weeks ago and they only had the two fairly large sizes, the price of which caused me concern. I therefore opted to experiment with a somewhat less expensive Carolan's, which I have found to be very good. However, it's difficult to compare without a true side-by-side. Therefore it occurred to me to consult the wisdom of a more experience crowd.

So, my question: What do the Irish think of Carolan's versus Bailey's?

Secondly, upon a recommendation (from r/CasualUK no less!) I tried a 50/50 Irish cream and milk and it was quite good. I wondered if I could get an ounce or two of Jameson's, which I find to have a hint of spice, to float on top of the thicker Irish cream. Or would the whiskey just mix in? I don't have any Jameson's to try. Any previously acquired scientific data appreciated.

milk AND price,xhrv7m,Cheap and Easy Meal Plans to ease costs,ireland,18,0.84,"I dont think its just me right now, but i certainly am starting to feel the pinch of rising costs. Every week im looking at trying to cut costs where I can. I rent in Dublin with my partner in a houseshare, saving for a mortgage. Im thankful that my rent isnt utterly extortionate at the moment but that may change we will see what my landlord gets up to in the next couple of months. 

I've done a couple of little changes that in my circumstances are feasible, such as stop buying coffee in work, hopping off the luas a couple of stops early for the lower fare and walking the rest of the way to work. The luas thing sounds utterly desperate i know, but it saves me about 20 quid a month but im getting more exercise in which im happy about. 

I also started using my revolut as a way to save a little more by using the vaults for my spare change which has been really handy getting some unexpected items but were needed badly. 

The food bill is the next think I looked at. And trying to cut down on that bill but not cut down nutrition wise either. What i have done is made meals plans and stick to them for breakfast lunch and dinner each week. I try keep it within a certain budget too. It doesnt always but i do tend to stick to it when i can. 

Mods im hoping this is allowed, i know there is a subreddit for cheap and healthy meals but it is definitely more American based and i figured it might help basing it with Irish prices. I want to share a meal plan and the cost of it to show people you can still eat well without spending a tonne of money on the food bill. I have included the total price in each calculation, obviously I have a lot left over such as porridge or frozen vegetables for example that I wouldn't totally use up that week. 

This is based for 2 people, 1 in the office 3 days a week 2 days at home, 1 in the office on shift work 4 days a week. I did my weekly shop between Dunnes and Lidl last week. Im fortunate that i have the option of both as well as other shops to pick from such as Aldi and Tesco if I need them. 

Breakfast: Porridge made with milk and a spoonful of jam and a banana.  (€4 between us, porridge not included as i got a 1.5kg bag free on my lidl plus app) 

Lunch: Ham, cheese and lettuce sandwich with homemade potato and leek soup (€8 between us)

Snacks: Apple, Orange, Plum (€1.50 between us depends on whats on offer)

Dinners for the week: 

Sunday: Roast chicken thighs, frozen veg, baby potatoes (€4.50)

Monday: Left over chicken and vegetables cooked with condensed cream of mushroom soup served with rice (€3.35, chicken and vegetables included in Sundays price)

Tuesday:  Green and Red Dahl made with chopped tomatoes, vegetables and coconut milk served with rice (€4.50, spices not included as already had cumin, chilli, garlic, ginger and turmeric to hand, cost of rice included in Monday's recipe)

Wednesday: Pasta with green pesto and cheese (€2.50, cost of cheese included in lunch price) 

Thursday: Left over from Tuesday's Dahl

Friday: Fish Finger and veggie pie topped with a mustard cheesy mash (€2.60, price of cheese included in lunch, mustard was already to hand but afaik the jar cost me 59cent in lidl)

Saturday is usually a takeout to treat ourselves. 

In total this shop came to €31 between the two of us and I still have frozen veg, porridge, rice, jam lentils left over for another week.  We did have to pop out and get more bread by the end of the week as the one we had started to turn, but that is to be expected. Sometimes i might have a money off voucher for Dunnes or Lidl will have something i need on offer in their app or something for free like that porridge, that helps me save a lot as well. 

I try change it up week to week and it goes by what's on offer. We have cut back on meat a good bit lately but if we are buying meat we make sure the meat we get we can stretch out like chicken thighs, pork lion or mince. 

Just thought this might give some people an idea of cutting back on the food bill and still make really nice food. Im more than happy to share some of my cheap and cheerful meals if anyone wants them. If anyone has any of their own I'd love to hear them.",2022-09-18,

Yet  it does not appear on any of their menus or websites.

I asked for one this morning in a Dublin City Centre Starbucks and the barista looked at his screen and exclaimed surprise that the “Short Cappuchino” was actually in the system. It cost Eur 2.55 (see receipt) which is 0.35c cheaper than the normally cheapest “Tall” option priced at EUR 2.90. It is two thirds the size of the tall cappuchino and they offered to put 2 shots of coffee in for no extra charge (I was told it usually comes with just 1 shot).

The drink itself was probably 60-40 Milk to Coffee which is a better taste ratio than most Starbucks offerings which are usually predominantly milk. So it doesn’t appear on their menus or their website but if you ask for it they will serve it to you no problem.",2013-04-19,
milk AND price,23uln2,One Year a Paddy: Reflections on Ireland from a Yank,ireland,151,0.86,"I moved from the USA to Ireland a little over a year ago and wanted to post some of my thoughts about the island.

* When I first moved over, I didn't know what to expect.  My family's not Irish, so I had no preconceived notions of hunting down long lost relatives or visiting a small ancestral cottage in Kerry.  I've found when I tell people I'm not of Irish descent, they almost always like me right away.    I guess this speaks to just how annoying many tourists must be.

* On that topic I have, surprisingly, had many people tell me about their family that moved to America, and got to experience just how boring it is hearing someone else's family history.

* The variation in accents is fascinating to me.  How could such a small place have such different ways of talking?  Whenever I would meet someone who's accent I hadn't heard before, say Cork or Carlow, I would always be dumbfounded and find them incomprehensible.

* A lot of people ask me if Irish people are really as big into drinking as the stereotype suggests.  The thing is that if you don't go to the pub, at least every once and a while, people will consider you weird.  I've always liked going out to drink, and don't find that people drink more necessarily, but that it's social protocol to go out to the pub.

* On that note, Guinness really is much different here than it is in the US.  I would rarely drink it before I moved here, but now won't drink anything else.

* The amount of litter is always amazing to me.  I understand that on a Saturday morning the sidewalk around a chipper is going to be a mess, but it goes beyond that.  People will throw trash anywhere.  The state of rivers in even a small town is evidence of how little people seem to care about making an otherwise picturesque place look like garbage.

* The meats and dairy products, specifically lamb, are something to be proud of.   I can't tell you how nice it is compared to what we have in America.  Milk too, and I come from a state that people brag about their milk.  I know it's getting better, but I've always found the dairy aisles funny for the sheer amount of cheddar and no other type of cheese.  I remember telling friends, ""You guys know  there's more than one type of cheese, right?""

* The people are great.  75% of them, anyways.  They'll take time out of their day to show you how to get somewhere and then say you should come by for tea.  Irish moms are the best.  When I first moved over I wondered why people honked so much, assuming people were very angry drivers.  It took me a while to figure out they were saying hello to a friend walking down the street.  25% of the people, though, are just gigantic assholes that wouldn't spit on you to put out a fire because they don't like your face and when they get drunk...

* Everyone knows EVERYONE.  I can't tell you how many times I've overheard two strangers have this conversation in a pub: ""Oh sure, your mom is my neighbor's cousin's barber.  Sure, I know about you.""

* There's something I have started to call ""Irish Time.""  Someone says meet you at 9 it means 9:15, someone tells you a couple of days it means a week, you need paperwork from the government and they say it will take a month or two then may God have mercy on your soul.

* The price of some things are astounding.  Car insurance is how much?  You have to pay to HAVE a TV?  I couldn't believe it.  Never take for granted, though, how great it is to only have to pay 50 euro to see a doctor without insurance.

* Hatred towards Travellers is shocking to me.  I know it's a controversial subject, but to me, it's embarrassing for all parties involved.

* Before I moved to Ireland I could count the number of times I went to church on my fingers.  Since moving here I've been to mass six or seven times, and I'm not even Catholic.   

* I think a lot of Irish people like to talk bad about their country.  They don't like it an want to move to Australia as soon as they get a chance.  They think that if you don't live in Dublin that life will be a nightmare.  I personally think that there is so much to be proud of.  It is a truly unique country with some of the best people you'd ever like to meet.",2014-04-24,
milk AND price,nxg988,Is Irish beef considered good in Ireland?,ireland,45,0.35,"I've been thinking about this for several years now. In my country we got our own domestic beef on sale in ordinary grocery store alongside Irish beef which is usually about half the price of the domestic ones.

Unsurprisingly the domestic stuff is widely considered better because of less antibiotics and stuff, along with the fact that people like supporting local production.

Anyway. In Ireland, is the domestic beef considered the ""better alternative""? Are there even imported stuff that's cheaper?

In short, how's the beef situation over there?

(While we're at it, is the situation regarding pork and chicken the same?)

Edit: fixed the misconception about the antibiotics line. The general consensus over here seem to be that Irish beef producers use more antibiotics than domestic. I got no numbers for Ireland, but that's still what the general population believe.

Edit: I also want to be clear that I mean ""fresh"" beef. Not frozen. However, chicken is often sold frozen here so if you have anything to add about chicken in Ireland, please take this into consideration.

Last edit: while I don't care much for downvotes I apparently need to clarify that I am not out to vilify the Irish meat industry or anything. Keep your national pride or whatever. I only made this post to get to know more about the whole situation, there are some apparent cultural differences here that I didn't know about before and I am grateful for anyone who spent their time to give their view on it.

milk AND price,a46y77,The Blú Vest Movement Research...let's have a conversation,ireland,41,0.37,"
**The Buí Vest Movement**
 
(Buí is irish for yellow)

  
*Summary*


'When' is a difficult question because I don't have a crystal ball (!) but 'how' I could research a little and maybe someone else can take the torch from here. 

-

 **HOW DO WE START A YELLOW VEST MOVEMENT IN IRELAND**



 **First the source of the YV**

&gt;Although the citizen 'Yellow Vest' movement — called so because of the high visibility jackets French motorists have to carry in their cars — started over high fuel prices, it has since mutated into a crisis about spending power and inequalities.
https://www.euronews.com/amp/2018/12/07/yellow-vests-what-s-driving-the-anger

 **Summary of them**

So it's driven by one group like the French motorists in this case. They felt they had justification at the vicious rise in fuel prices, **a all encompassing reason** 
Anyone who drives will tell you that even 10% hike is massive never mind what they were going to endure. A climbdown has since happened but only for 6 months. 

 **Conclusion on yellow vest**


So it's need to be massive group with a very clear objective. What we would need is a similar effect from a middle class group, I'm guessing. 

 **Questionable groups I would 'personally' would rule out because of size of appeal**
 

The groups here like trade unions involved in disputes, farmers , bus drivers etc. 


Small businesses getting taxed or omitted from budgets cuts .

The homeless Raise the roof 

The political groups like PBP, etc etc, all in the Dail with a seat and pension etc

  **Reason I'd rule them out:**


I could never see any of them grabbing a large mass of people like you or your family members getting stung with high fuel prices , they don't have a big enough cause , in my very humble opinion. I love the IFA and their proactive 'sheep firing around the Dail gates' (!) but they are not getting that traction unless their CAP type funding of milk quota was pulled. I just couldn't see everyone beeping their horns at them but perhaps I'm wrong 


 **Potential Cause**


Here's one that's starting to maybe grow a little that 'might' migrate into the yellow vest in France, it's the environment. 

&gt;In his editorial, Dion writes that the struggle for economic and social equality cannot be disconnected from the fight for environmental justice: “Let us show that we French people are capable of rising en masse for things greater than ourselves,” he implored. “The revolutionaries of 1789 rose up against the price of bread, the famine, and inequalities. But they did not stop there. They created the rights of man and citizen. You rose up because of fuel and against taxes. Together, let’s create a society where the survival of all is more important than the profits of a few.”
https://qz.com/1486158/can-frances-yellow-vests-go-green-one-activist-thinks-so/amp/


 **Overall Conclusion on environment movement**


This may sound ageist but the kids today are just better at understanding the absolute havoc we are doing to our earth, they care far more than maybe we did or were required too...Captain Planet was about all that got our eyebrows raised!. 

They are seeing further , perhaps hundreds of years ahead and want change badly. In those hands we might see 'the buí vest' being pulled on. 


PLEASE NOTE: This is for people who want to research this or have a conversation. I wrote this because I'm curious how we could start one because i don't see a better society , just a richer one for a few. I would like cheaper places to live in and better prices for things ...and our governments don't seem to want this as much as I do. Maybe we can at least say we tried

I know I give out about Ireland all the time, and I have some obsession about focusing on the negatives of this place, and moaning and bitching about all the stuff I hate.... but I'm so glad to be home.   

I flew into Belfast at around 12:30 - got to passport control and your man scaning my passport was like ""jesus must be a shock getting off the plane into this friggin weather - but welcome home!""  
Belfast arrivals hall: My daughter runs up to me, completely past the security line and jumps onto me - security guy just smiles at us and waves us on.   
Bus from airport to car park: Driver says ""Welcome back to this aul shite, sure if you's didn't come back I wouldn't have this job. What's the wee one getting for Christmas?"" I, half asleep told him I wasn't sure what Santa was bringing and he handed her a little model plane.   

We drove home, stopping off for food in the pub near my house as there was no food at home - pub staff, who I don't even really know asked how was the holiday, talked for a little bit about it, and said we looked like we needed a seat by the fire, so we got one.  

Then went to Centra to get milk as I wasn't sure what was in the house - the girl in Centra asked how I've been and was I away, I don't even know her name...  

When we got home finally - the neighbours called over with mince pies they baked and a bottle of mulled wine. I'm off the booze so the bf took that one with him, but the mince pies were scoffed.  

I love Ireland. I know I give it shit sometimes but really you would not get friendlier people in the world. I had a similar experience when I came back from 6 months working in the states.  
You get such a welcome home from everyone, even people who hardly know you.  

I know I give this place shit a lot, with rent prices, shitty transport, insurance, etc... but there really is no place like home :)

dairy AND quality,yioxfk,Is it truly unaffordable for lower-income families to eat healthi?,ireland,167,0.68,"Very often I read that obesity is rife among low-income families because they can’t afford to buy fresh, good-quality ingredients and thus resort to ‘top-shelf products’ like pot noodles, which are €1 each. I’m slightly sceptical of this view. One of my favourite meals is courgettes &amp; bacon with spaghetti. When I add up how much this costs for 4 people this is how it works out: €1.19 for two courgettes (500g), 125g bacon (€1), onion (25c), olive oil (10c from big bottle), 400g spaghetti (€1.50), 4 eggs (€1.20) and some Parmesan (30c from packet). So this amounts to €5.50 overall or €1.40 per person for a family of 4 -  not much more than the €1 pot noodles but much more nutritious and filling. And not particularly time-consuming.

There are so many other meals that can be made cheaply on a strict budget - videos on Youtube show how to make things like curry for under $10 for example (these videos are mainly produced by Americans but use ingredients widely available in Ireland). 

This all leads me to believe that ignorance/lack of time/laziness are more to blame for obesity than lack of money. I don’t think ‘inability to cook’ is really an excuse - basically anyone can learn how to cook a decent meal from YouTube tutorials or from other sources online. Furthermore, the quality of produce in Ireland is second to none (consider the dairy and meat for example), so if people do decide to cook their own meals they’ll be highly nutritious (unlike in the US where he quality of meat an be poor).

No surprise here, but everything just seems to be getting worse. I know you're all excited about Kerrygold being exported all over the world, but at what cost? The rush to dairy, among other things, has meant our waterways are becoming more and more polluted.

As you can see from the graph in the diagram, human waste is also a factor in waterway quality with agriculture being miles in front as the worst polluters.

We have the least tree coverage in Europe bar Malta, which is a speck in the Med, and are undergoing a biodiversity crisis. Air pollution is getting worse.

The comments are the usual morons talking about India and China. I didn't realise India and China are polluting our air and waterways! We also have a much higher footprint than both of these countries, and it's rich countries like Ireland who are buying the rubbish from dirty factories in China. China, who I believe will be world leaders in green tech sooner or later.

Roses : a classic but don't think they have aged well. Almost sickly sweet.

Quality street: would always be last ones opened when I was a kid. Don't see them too often.

Celebrations : great on paper but it gets old fairly fast. Promotes small versions of the bars but the nicest is the malteaser one designed just for the tins.

Cadbury Heros : I think these would be the new king if they dumped that creme egg one. In reality is just loads of Cadbury chocolate which is in no way a bad thing. Imagine a malteasers truffle like one but with crunchie instead. 


All ""tins"" need to increase their size or amount. 


About 15 years ago I emailed Cadbury with an idea. A tin of sweets made up of squares from their signature bars individually wrapped. A tin where you could pull out a square of mint crisp, golden crisp, Turkish delight, caramello, whole nut, fruit and nut, dairy milk. Call them squares, they're already making the fecking bars so chop them up take my money. I got a thank you for your idea but we don't deal with outside sources for product ideas. Crazy fools.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

dairy AND grass,p10ls6,"Misleading terminology: ""carbon sink""",ireland,25,0.79,"Almost every time I see reference to a ""carbon sink"" in non-scientific publications or journalism, it seems to be presented as something that makes CO2 disappear from the atmosphere. This is true only if its mass is increasing.

""Carbon sinks"" basically represent carbon that's already been sunk. If you take water out of the equation, plants and trees are mostly carbon. Soil is only something for them to grow in, it's not what they're made of. Plants and animals take carbon out of the air and turn it into cells: we are carbon-based lifeforms.

Usually those carbon atoms are attached to water molecules. If you break that attachment you get energy. This is why dead plants make good food (CARBOhydrates) and good fuel (hydroCARBONs.)

Wood burns well if you leave it dry out, bogs burn well if you dry them out, and petrochemicals (which form if some carbon sink is brought underground by geological processes and allowed decompose very, very slowly for at least a few ten thousands of years.) Whether you burn them or eat them, that carbon is set free again.

(Those sinks can include massive accumulations of animals (usually plankton,) but their decay takes even longer still.)

The Farmer's Journal will say that a lovely green field is a carbon sink, which it is...while grass is growing. As soon as that grass is cut and turned into hay which will feed the dairy industry the sink has been emptied. All that carbon will be put back into the atmosphere. An absolutely inconsequential amount of carbon ends up ""sequestered"" in the soil of a pasture.

It's not even antiintellectualism, it's doublespeak and propaganda - **""emissions"" and ""rising CO2 levels"" can be understood by anyone as a mass balance equation**: there is too much carbon in the atmosphere, plants take that atmospheric carbon and lock it away. There's no need to think about concentrations or PPMs: the weight of carbon in the plant matter you grow must equal the weight of atmospheric carbon we need to remove. These are both things you can measure in kilograms. It isn't rocket science. Don't cut bogs, don't plant to harvest, grow forests rather than plantations.

He owned a cottage, barn, 30 acres, and a small herd of cows.  He was very fond of the cows and wanted them to continue living in their familiar surroundings.  The old farmer's will stipulated that all his property be placed into a trust for the benefit of the cows.  The cottage was rented and monthly income was allocated for property upkeep and veterinary service for the cows.  A neighboring dairy farmer, who was a dear friend of the deceased, came to the farm daily to milk the cows and kept the milk as his payment.

dairy AND farmers,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.77,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

We've read up on the visa/work/naturalization process and it seems fairly easy for us (coming from the U.S.A.) to move to Ireland. He has a wonderful career in clinical healthcare/healthcare administration, and I have experience in horticulture, teaching, and caregiving. Our expenses our low, the area we live in is safe, but the satisfaction of life leaves something to be desired. Currently we are apathetic to the U.S.A. at best and despise it at worst. It's not the kind of culture we would like to raise future children in (or live in ourselves.) We anticipate a move to a northern state in the U.S.A. (we live in the south) next year, but after that happens, we keep coming back to Ireland as a possibility. My great-great-grandparents came over to America from Ireland, but now I'd like to get the hell out. 

We are about 45% sure at this moment that we want to drop everything we know and start a dairy farm in Ireland. We only expect this percentage to increase as time goes on.

2. What cities or locations would be best suited for us?

dairy AND farmers,p10ls6,"Misleading terminology: ""carbon sink""",ireland,25,0.77,"Almost every time I see reference to a ""carbon sink"" in non-scientific publications or journalism, it seems to be presented as something that makes CO2 disappear from the atmosphere. This is true only if its mass is increasing.

""Carbon sinks"" basically represent carbon that's already been sunk. If you take water out of the equation, plants and trees are mostly carbon. Soil is only something for them to grow in, it's not what they're made of. Plants and animals take carbon out of the air and turn it into cells: we are carbon-based lifeforms.

Usually those carbon atoms are attached to water molecules. If you break that attachment you get energy. This is why dead plants make good food (CARBOhydrates) and good fuel (hydroCARBONs.)

Wood burns well if you leave it dry out, bogs burn well if you dry them out, and petrochemicals (which form if some carbon sink is brought underground by geological processes and allowed decompose very, very slowly for at least a few ten thousands of years.) Whether you burn them or eat them, that carbon is set free again.

(Those sinks can include massive accumulations of animals (usually plankton,) but their decay takes even longer still.)

The Farmer's Journal will say that a lovely green field is a carbon sink, which it is...while grass is growing. As soon as that grass is cut and turned into hay which will feed the dairy industry the sink has been emptied. All that carbon will be put back into the atmosphere. An absolutely inconsequential amount of carbon ends up ""sequestered"" in the soil of a pasture.

It's not even antiintellectualism, it's doublespeak and propaganda - **""emissions"" and ""rising CO2 levels"" can be understood by anyone as a mass balance equation**: there is too much carbon in the atmosphere, plants take that atmospheric carbon and lock it away. There's no need to think about concentrations or PPMs: the weight of carbon in the plant matter you grow must equal the weight of atmospheric carbon we need to remove. These are both things you can measure in kilograms. It isn't rocket science. Don't cut bogs, don't plant to harvest, grow forests rather than plantations. If you see this framed as hippy bullshit, you are being deceived. Notice which publications or advocacy groups or people have been seen to deceive, in any direction, and stop trusting them FFS.",2021-08-09,

dairy AND farmers,xc90tp,New Policies By The Leprechaun Council Part 1,ireland,7,0.23,"Disclaimer: The following is a sarcastic take on the way people are getting fleeced in the country. The content of this article should not be taken as a professional recommendation by any unprofessional politicians who are running this place to the ground. If they do implement these as laws, please don't blame me... 


The grand council of Leprechauns has identified that the current issues faced by the people of Ireland stem from four main elements. 

1. A lack of housing 

2. The inflation in the market 

3. Lack of infrastructure (public transportation, energy production, schools , hospitals  , a functional airport or roads without potholes) 

4. Lack of money that is available to spend on the above. 

In order to combat these issues , we have devised a series of measures that should solve these problems. 

1.  A Graveyard Tax: 

It has come to our attention that alot of prime real estate is being taken up by the graves of people who are dead. Every individual is taking up a space of almost 20 square foot of space in a grave site. That's more space than a typical student accommodation! 

At this rate, we will have most of the land taken over by graveyards within a few centuries. So we hereby propose that every individual who wants to have a graveyard of the standard size , establish a trust fund that will pay a graveyard tax to the government in perpetuity. The fund needs to take into consideration the inflation trend and account for a 20% increase in estimated costs every year the graveyard will be occupied. Should your fund run out or you become delinquent in the payment, then the corpse will be exhumed and processed into bone meal for the gardens of the tech companies who are keeping the country afloat. 

For those who don't have the facility to pay said graveyard tax, you will have the option of a viking burial ( toss your corpse out on the ocean on a plyboard and light it up). This option will be subject to a carbon tax , depending on how much smoke you emit as your corpse burns. However, in the current market rend , we are sure you would have withered down to your bones due to the cost of living and hence your carbon tax would probably be covered by your pension fund. 

Another alternative for those who want to ensure their loved ones have a place to visit, is the tower of eternal slumber. This will be a multistory tower where each deceased individual will be intered in a block sized coffin and it will be arranged like Jenga blocks to ensure maximum space efficiencty. Our biggest sponsor , Demazon has offered to provide their expertise in warehouse management to help us build this structure. This however comes with a rental cost and if your loved ones are unable to pay the rent then your remains will become the property of Demazon to use as they see fit { Message from our sponsor: Demazon is now offering Fertilizer, pet food and calcium supplements at exciting prices }

If you have no money whatsoever and your loved ones are already burdened with the struggles of day to day living, then you have the exciting opportunity to volunteer yourself as a lab test subject to any of our pharmaceutical partners. This option will allow you to do your part for the future of humanity and the company would happily provide you with a vertical grave as a permanent resting place. Recent studies have shown the benefits of standing rather than sitting or sleeping. So these firms will offer you an ergonomically vertical graveyard after they have used your body for their nefarious purposes. 

2. Tax On Unauthorized Expulsion Of Gaseous Waste ( Fart /burp tax) 

Our minister for purple energy has identified that emissions of methane in all forms is a significant contributor to global warming. While the current measures are already working on taxing the farmers to their bones and making them take a shotgun to their cattle; we need to expand our carbon tax further. 

Henceforth, every individual would be expected to pay a fart tax along with their PRSI , USC , TV Tax, VAT  and the arbitrary taxes we come up with , promise to remove after a while but never do. The fart tax would be paid based on an estimated emission of fart based on your age , size , dietary pattern and dairy consumption. You will ofcourse have to do most of the work in calculating these and entering relevant information in our revenue website. At the end of the year, you will have to submit notarized affadavits to claim any fart free periods. When you purchase beans , dairy or other items that have been linked to causing said emissions, you will be taxed additionally at the checkout counter. Restaurants serving foods that cause flatulence will have the option of levying the tax on your bill. 

We will be conducting random assessment on your gaseous emission to ensure you are within your limits. An inspector will follow you around with a fart meter behind you and will give an assessment on your emmision level. 

Alternatively, you can install a smart fart meter on your rear that would directly link your emmision to our system. 


The tax will have provision to further expand into a breathing tax which is currently being researched. It has come to our attention that individuals who breathe are causing more expenses than those who don't for the government. Hence we will soon be expanding this tax to incentivize people to stop breathing. Remember,these taxes are a measure to incentivize positive behavior, not make money off you...

dairy AND farmers,ep8f7i,2000 Kilometers around Ireland - A great journey &amp; my thoughts,ireland,22,0.88,"Dear irish people and ireland lovers,

in September 2019 i sat myself in the plane to Dublin, rented a car and started to explore the island for 7 days without pretty much research about famous sights and things. This might be sound strange in the 21st century with Phones´n Apps´n Net, but it´s way more fun to figure out what people and locals tell you on the road.. or sometimes unfortunately not. Of course, completly without phone is unconvenient. Especially with maps, airbnb and food spots. But making plans on the road works pretty fine for me for some years already and meeting and hanging out with local people is the best.

The trip started immediately incredibly good.. Jeez, irish people are so welcoming, heartwarming and nice, that i felt very cozy on that small and sometimes creepy roads and cottages. I thought, it might be war on those tiny roads, but they´re all so polite drivers and i swear, in 2k Kilometers i only freaked out 1 or 2 times, while furious road rage and shouting at people is a speciality in germany, where i´m from, btw. Almost everyone is greeting or waving at you (in a friendly way) and if there´s a question about anything, well.. Don´t dare to ask. It seemed like i found the goldpot on the end of the rainbow before i even slid it down and high fived the goblin... Already on day No.1!

I met incredibly nice characters, of all facettes and ages that i´m feeling like a fanboy telling all my friends that i was in ireland and compare each country now with ireland like i´m Howard Wollowitz who came lately from space. There was Phil the dairy farmer or Brigid the shepherd.. and so many more. Those 7 days was actually a constant hussle. Everyday booking and finding a new airbnb (which wasn´t that cheap btw), doing the new route, recording vlogs.. But it doesn´t felt like it was stressful. I enjoyed almost every minute with all the people i met and the perfect nature i saw. For sure, i´m very focused on meeting people and wanna see how they live and learn about their culture. That´s why i drove 95% countryroads, visiting each little village where sometimes the center was only one house with some dogs. But it´s time consuming. For 250Km way by car, you´re on the track for 3-4h. And this brings me to the most important point: Time management. I think i did the best with the time i had. In 7 days i had like 2 very rainy and one slight rainy day. The 2 bad ones i used to stick more on the road and approach the west of the island earlier (which was a very nice move, turned out later) and that other day i was really mad, because it destroyed my experience in Galway, which i skipped after being bloody wet. But all in all i was lucky and got accostumed to wind and quick weather changes pretty fast. Sometimes i still have this fine sea breeze in my nose.. Which i like so damn much. Anyway. The car gives such an huge advantage, especially when it comes to the airbnbs, which was -in my case- everytime located in the deepest countryside and yes.. The first and second approach to my cozy beds led me through mysterious and ancient roads, covered by green and ol´ rocks while the sun was almost gone. But everytime a host opened the door, it felt like home. Jeez.. How i miss salty irish butter and some fresh cones.

The only thing on the downside: It´s pricey. Don´t get me wrong, it´s nice and all and of course people need to live. But sometimes it was a bit outrageous here and there when it came to groceries or eating in pub/restaurant. Though on the upside the meals are very big i´ve to admit. But transport, fuel etc. is expensive. I paid for a 5min ferry ride like 20€. One way. The flight from germany though is a joke and.. I don´t know how to say it, but cmon. 60€ Two way ticket?! The filling of water of the toilets in the plane are even more expensive. I don´t wanna talk about economics (which i did in the middle of nowhere in a lonely rock desert in my favorite area ""Achill Islands"" with a stranger) but this cheap flying is curse and blessing big time. I talked with a shepherd about it and he said, a ride with the train from the Dingle Area to Dublin is more expensive. Freaky times.

All in all this road trip was one of my favorite trips so far and i just can recommend to everyone to go there while it´s off season and all the majority of tourists are gone. I had so many many places almost for me alone.. It felt like i´ve chosen the perfect time to go there. No super packed places, no queues, no overloaded roads.

As i mentioned it above, i do simple vlogs with an action cam, not money orientated, i make a living with a regular job like everyone else and just use it as a diary, while i travel most of the time alone and sometimes with my girlfriend. I still upload weekly storys since September from Ireland with all the people i met there and i invite you besides this ""little"" roman here to come over and have a watch while you´re at dinner or something. My favorite one so far is the experience with the lovely shepherd lady. [https://www.youtube.com/danabroad](https://www.youtube.com/danabroad)

dairy AND farmers,oduv9m,Societal progress,ireland,17,0.52,"I wrote a comment earlier on about how people turn their noses up at societal progress when jobs are on the line and it got me thinking about animal based farming. 

I'd be really interested to hear Irish people's view on lessening animal based farming in the pursuit of societal progress (less food/water waste, better for the environment, better for animal suffering - amongst others)

I'm aware that many livelihoods in Ireland revolve around farming animals, but if lessening that brings benefits to society and future generations then surely that's not something to turn your nose up to? 

Hope this doesn't come across as aggressive or as a form of activism, I'm just curious to hear opinions :)",2021-07-04,

If that wasnt bad enough the second ad which was an update, about the members of the board selling off ALL of their PLC shares in the co op, while simultaneously trying to convince farmers to buy more shares ""to get a fairer price for their milk"" http://www.donedeal.ie/dairycattle-for-sale/glanbia-shares-amp-mpa/10517172?offset=1[2]

now to add to that there is speculation that our general election might be forced early, possibly in November of this year rather than may of next year, and the government have remained silent. We are having our annual budget this month, which is said to be a very generous budget, the reinstatement of the Christmas bonus It feels like they are trying to buy us off before something terrible happens, i have also heard roomers of closures and job losses in the food industry right across my locality (i live in the golden vale and there are dozens of cheese and meat factories around us and most of my cousins work in the cheese factories, my partner used to work in one of the meat factories, most of his friends still do)

What do you guys think is going on? there seems to be a lot going on at the moment.

Duncan Munro, managing director of Carr’s Flour Mills in Kirkcaldy, also warned loaves could disappear from shop shelves altogether if negotiations between Britain and Brussels don’t get back on track.

Modelling by the UK Trade Policy Observatory found that even if the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU to keep tariffs at zero and minimise other disruption, the cost of border inspections and barriers would see food prices rise by 3.8%.

A report by the House of Lords European Union Committee said: “The predicted increase varies depending on the type of food: bread and cereals were expected to increase in price by 1.4%, meat by 3.3%, fish by 1.8%, dairy products by 4.3%, fruit by 5.1% and vegetables by 4.8%.”

If the UK was to leave the EU without a deal, it would mean trade in food with Europe will be subject to World Trade Organization tariffs and Brussels’ own stringent checks on the safety of food entering the bloc.

With six months to go until exit day and both sides still struggling to reach any kind of agreement, Mr Munro said the loss of free trade with Europe “would be disastrous”.

The extent of the difficulties, he said, would depend on what kind of deal, if any, the UK Government strikes with the European Union.

Mr Munro said the cost of wheat, of which the company process approximately 300,000 tonnes a year at mills at Silloth and Maldon in England, as well as Kirkcaldy, has already increased by around 20% compared to last year.

Part of the reason for this is the volatility of the pound, which has dipped regularly around major UK Government announcements linked to leaving the EU.

The hot summer has also been a major factor.
Duncan Munro, managing director of Carr’s Flour Mill, Kirkcaldy

Mr Munro said: “There is probably no sector with more at stake in Brexit negotiations than the UK food and drink industry.

“The food industry tends to be just in time. You can’t stockpile flour and bread. It’s a real just in time industry and if there was an interruption to the supply chain that meant bread wasn’t on the shelves it would be a disaster.

“Food is generally high volume and relatively low value. You don’t move high volume, low value products around the other side of the globe. You want to be trading with near neighbours, like Europe and Ireland.

“Any logistical interruption, which is highly likely, would be disastrous in the short term and potentially puts the price of bread up, which would obviously be bad.

“We as an individual business have not got time to try and second guess where the politicians are going to get us and plan accordingly.”

The People’s Vote campaign, which wants a second EU referendum, published research last month claiming household bills have increased by £417 a year since the June 2016 ballot.

The anti-Brexit group said a loaf of bread is now 6p more expensive, while a 250g pack of butter has increased by 43p.

Meanwhile, the milling industry in Ireland warned last year that Brexit could add ten cents to the price of a loaf of bread in the Emerald Isle.

Carr’s employs around 80 people in Fife. Mr Munro said: “It is frightening to think there is a possibility we are going back to the dark ages and not operating free trade in agriculture and food. It’s a horrible prospect. It would be a disaster.”

Scotland AND dairy AND EU,z9ixce,"Brexit added nearly £6bn to UK food bills in two years, research finds",Scotland,19,0.91,"&gt;Brexit added almost £6bn to UK food bills in the two years to the end of 2021, affecting poorest households the most, research has found.
&gt;
&gt;The cost of food imported from the EU shot up because of extra red tape, adding £210 to the average household food bills over 2020 and 2021, London School of Economics (LSE) researchers discovered.
&gt;
&gt;As low-income families spend a greater share of their income on food, the impact of Brexit on their purchases was disproportionately greater, they said.
&gt;
&gt;The research comes the day after data from the British Retail Consortium trade body showed UK food price inflation hit a record high of 12.4% in November as the price of basics such as eggs, dairy products and coffee rose.
&gt;
&gt;Researchers at the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the LSE studied micro data-tracking trade flows and consumer prices for food products in the UK to identify the transfer of the cost of Brexit red tape to householders.
&gt;
&gt;“We find that leaving the European Union increased the price of food products by 3% a year, leading to a 6% increase over a two-year period,” they say in their report, named Non-tariff barriers and consumer prices: evidence from Brexit.
&gt;
&gt;Its calculations translated to a £5.84bn cost to the food market alone, equating to £210 per household.

Fantastic news, I'm glad Labour and the Tories have guaranteed us Brexit means Brexit and it will absolutely carry on as is till at least 2029.

 &gt;A SCOTTISH firm has revealed how it was forced to abandon all trade with Europe after Brexit hammered the “nail into the coffin” of its export business.
&gt;
&gt;Andrew Duff, who runs butchers MacDuff 1890, said it’s now easier to export to Hong Kong than it is to Europe.
&gt;
&gt;The Wishaw-based business, a 4th generation butchers which sells high-quality, specialist meat, had been shipping goods to the EU for years prior to Brexit.
&gt;
&gt;Duff said it was as easy as filling in an order and pressing go. But now, it’s economically unviable.

Anyhow, last week I was invited to a colleague's ""dinner party"" at her new home down in Whitecraigs (wanky wee suburb in Glasgow) where I was served something that resembled *this*.  Yeah.  I was lectured - *lectured* \- for about an hour as to the provenance of the fish, of the tatties, even which free-range organic bullshit cow boob-juice farm they got their milk from and it was shite.  Seriously, it was Baxters-level shite.  My recipe is much, much better (as it's my gran's).  Honestly, I despair of some people.  This is one of those recipes that has staunchly working-class roots in Scotland and yet, because of the price of decent fish these days, has slowly become something more prone to grace the dining tables of middle-class arsewipes and those who think they ""know"" Scotland.  It's meant to be simple, and it's meant to be made with very few ingredients.  Oh, and word of warning:  there’s no way to make this vegan.  You’re plain out of luck, lentil-lickers…

*You’ll need…*

**350g of smoked haddock fillet.**  Now, word to the wise (or idiots) - use an undyed haddock.  The reason?  Dyed smoked haddock has the ability to turn what is essentially a creamy white soup into something, erm, yellow.  You don’t want a jaundiced potage.

**1 onion**, chopped.

**Bouquet garni**.  Now, this is optional, but this is my gran’s recipe, so I’m including it.  I just tend to stick to salt and pepper.  And so should you.

**500g of floury potatoes**, quartered.

**900ml water**

**600ml of good full-fat milk.**  None of that shitey “half and half” or “semi-skimmed” or “oat milk” here.

**40g of butter**

(Optional!) **Chopped chives to garnish**.  Now, see, I’m not one of those people who like to add shitey chives - one of Nature’s blandest plants - to a dish purely because it “adds visual interest”.  If I wanted “visual interest” I’d add a wean’s finger or a couple of cat hairs, not a pishy green *thing* that looks as useful as a chocolate teapot.  Honestly.

*To make…*

Start with the fish.  It’s the star of this dish.  Put the fish, onion and bouquet garni with the water into a large heavy-based pan and bring to the boil.  Shoo any suddenly-ravenous wee felines who may have “accidentally” wandered in.  Use a wooden spoon to chase them out if you have to (but, be warned.  Cats have very long memories and you will wake up tomorrow morning to find that Mr Fuzzywinkles has taken a long and leisurely shite down the back of your sofa.  And it’ll smell.  Oh yes, he’ll make sure of that.

Now, skim the scum from the surface, then cover and reduce the heat to poach fish gently for around ten to fifteen minutes.  Lift the haddock from the pan gently - I said gently, you fucking hippo - cool slightly, then remove the skin and bones.

Now, top tip time - to remove the bones, you’ll need to start by flaking the fish and the bones should reveal themselves like that time my grandfather killed a heron that was terrorising my aunt in their back garden and didn’t dig it it a deep-enough grave so that eventually its bony fury was brought back to the surface.  It may have been assisted by my mother digging it up (we’re not sure, the details are fuzzy).  If you’re having problems removing the bones, then instead of mocking you (like I would) get a pair of kitchen tweezers and use those to remove the bones.  You can also use these to pluck those fucking caterpillars that are copulating on your face, Sharon.  Seriously, they’re like two wee hairy arms.

Now, you should have a wee pile of flaked fish and another wee pile of fish skin and bones.  Put the fish to one side - out of reach of any felines - and return the skin and bones to the pan and simmer for thirty minutes.  After thirty minutes, strain the stock through a fine sieve and return the stock to the pan (if you’ve managed to piss all that delicious fishy stock down the drain, congratulations, you’re a fucking moron and I hope you’ve been sterilised).

Add the potatoes and simmer for another twenty-five minutes.  Remove the potatoes from the pan using a slotted spoon, add the milk and slowly bring to the boil.  Now, here’s where things get a bit tricksy.

One of the most common modern additions to Cullen Skink is double cream.  You’re not a fuckwit, you’re not going to add this.  No sir.  To thicken this soup you’ll need one of your ingredients - the more experienced cooks are already going “ah-hah!” whilst the idiot brigade are going “der?”  To thicken the soup, you’ll need to break up the potatoes.  Now, how thick you want it depends on how broken you want your potatoes.  Want a thin soup?  Leave them mostly intact.  Want a soup as dense as a Valley Girl, then you mash those tatties.  Either way, do not forget to add the butter to the soup as you’re adding the potatoes.

After you’ve added your tatties, add the fish - not the skin, you’ll need that to run around the house terrifying your children with - and heat through.  Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly.  Ladle into warmed bowls (unless you’re a cheap cunt from Bristol and insist on serving soup in cold bowls).  If you’re being a wanky prick sprinkle on your chives, if not, garnish with a wee dusting of black pepper and serve!",2022-05-01,

dairy AND EU,9k1vip,"Six months to Brexit: Leaving EU will mean paying more dough for your loaf, warns leading producer",Scotland,19,0.77,"The price of bread could rise because of Brexit, according to the boss of Scotland’s most modern flour mill.


Duncan Munro, managing director of Carr’s Flour Mills in Kirkcaldy, also warned loaves could disappear from shop shelves altogether if negotiations between Britain and Brussels don’t get back on track.

Modelling by the UK Trade Policy Observatory found that even if the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU to keep tariffs at zero and minimise other disruption, the cost of border inspections and barriers would see food prices rise by 3.8%.

A report by the House of Lords European Union Committee said: “The predicted increase varies depending on the type of food: bread and cereals were expected to increase in price by 1.4%, meat by 3.3%, fish by 1.8%, dairy products by 4.3%, fruit by 5.1% and vegetables by 4.8%.”

If the UK was to leave the EU without a deal, it would mean trade in food with Europe will be subject to World Trade Organization tariffs and Brussels’ own stringent checks on the safety of food entering the bloc.

With six months to go until exit day and both sides still struggling to reach any kind of agreement, Mr Munro said the loss of free trade with Europe “would be disastrous”.

The extent of the difficulties, he said, would depend on what kind of deal, if any, the UK Government strikes with the European Union.

Mr Munro said the cost of wheat, of which the company process approximately 300,000 tonnes a year at mills at Silloth and Maldon in England, as well as Kirkcaldy, has already increased by around 20% compared to last year.

Part of the reason for this is the volatility of the pound, which has dipped regularly around major UK Government announcements linked to leaving the EU.

The hot summer has also been a major factor.
Duncan Munro, managing director of Carr’s Flour Mill, Kirkcaldy

Mr Munro said: “There is probably no sector with more at stake in Brexit negotiations than the UK food and drink industry.

“The food industry tends to be just in time. You can’t stockpile flour and bread. It’s a real just in time industry and if there was an interruption to the supply chain that meant bread wasn’t on the shelves it would be a disaster.

“Food is generally high volume and relatively low value. You don’t move high volume, low value products around the other side of the globe. You want to be trading with near neighbours, like Europe and Ireland.

“Any logistical interruption, which is highly likely, would be disastrous in the short term and potentially puts the price of bread up, which would obviously be bad.

“We as an individual business have not got time to try and second guess where the politicians are going to get us and plan accordingly.”

The People’s Vote campaign, which wants a second EU referendum, published research last month claiming household bills have increased by £417 a year since the June 2016 ballot.

The anti-Brexit group said a loaf of bread is now 6p more expensive, while a 250g pack of butter has increased by 43p.

Meanwhile, the milling industry in Ireland warned last year that Brexit could add ten cents to the price of a loaf of bread in the Emerald Isle.

Carr’s employs around 80 people in Fife. Mr Munro said: “It is frightening to think there is a possibility we are going back to the dark ages and not operating free trade in agriculture and food. It’s a horrible prospect. It would be a disaster.”

Anyhow, last week I was invited to a colleague's ""dinner party"" at her new home down in Whitecraigs (wanky wee suburb in Glasgow) where I was served something that resembled *this*.  Yeah.  I was lectured - *lectured* \- for about an hour as to the provenance of the fish, of the tatties, even which free-range organic bullshit cow boob-juice farm they got their milk from and it was shite.  Seriously, it was Baxters-level shite.  My recipe is much, much better (as it's my gran's).  Honestly, I despair of some people.  This is one of those recipes that has staunchly working-class roots in Scotland and yet, because of the price of decent fish these days, has slowly become something more prone to grace the dining tables of middle-class arsewipes and those who think they ""know"" Scotland.  It's meant to be simple, and it's meant to be made with very few ingredients.  Oh, and word of warning:  there’s no way to make this vegan.  You’re plain out of luck, lentil-lickers…

*You’ll need…*

**350g of smoked haddock fillet.**  Now, word to the wise (or idiots) - use an undyed haddock.  The reason?  Dyed smoked haddock has the ability to turn what is essentially a creamy white soup into something, erm, yellow.  You don’t want a jaundiced potage.

**1 onion**, chopped.

**Bouquet garni**.  Now, this is optional, but this is my gran’s recipe, so I’m including it.  I just tend to stick to salt and pepper.  And so should you.

**500g of floury potatoes**, quartered.

**900ml water**

**600ml of good full-fat milk.**  None of that shitey “half and half” or “semi-skimmed” or “oat milk” here.

**40g of butter**

(Optional!) **Chopped chives to garnish**.  Now, see, I’m not one of those people who like to add shitey chives - one of Nature’s blandest plants - to a dish purely because it “adds visual interest”.  If I wanted “visual interest” I’d add a wean’s finger or a couple of cat hairs, not a pishy green *thing* that looks as useful as a chocolate teapot.  Honestly.

*To make…*

Start with the fish.  It’s the star of this dish.  Put the fish, onion and bouquet garni with the water into a large heavy-based pan and bring to the boil.  Shoo any suddenly-ravenous wee felines who may have “accidentally” wandered in.  Use a wooden spoon to chase them out if you have to (but, be warned.  Cats have very long memories and you will wake up tomorrow morning to find that Mr Fuzzywinkles has taken a long and leisurely shite down the back of your sofa.  And it’ll smell.  Oh yes, he’ll make sure of that.

Now, skim the scum from the surface, then cover and reduce the heat to poach fish gently for around ten to fifteen minutes.  Lift the haddock from the pan gently - I said gently, you fucking hippo - cool slightly, then remove the skin and bones.

Now, top tip time - to remove the bones, you’ll need to start by flaking the fish and the bones should reveal themselves like that time my grandfather killed a heron that was terrorising my aunt in their back garden and didn’t dig it it a deep-enough grave so that eventually its bony fury was brought back to the surface.  It may have been assisted by my mother digging it up (we’re not sure, the details are fuzzy).  If you’re having problems removing the bones, then instead of mocking you (like I would) get a pair of kitchen tweezers and use those to remove the bones.  You can also use these to pluck those fucking caterpillars that are copulating on your face, Sharon.  Seriously, they’re like two wee hairy arms.

Now, you should have a wee pile of flaked fish and another wee pile of fish skin and bones.  Put the fish to one side - out of reach of any felines - and return the skin and bones to the pan and simmer for thirty minutes.  After thirty minutes, strain the stock through a fine sieve and return the stock to the pan (if you’ve managed to piss all that delicious fishy stock down the drain, congratulations, you’re a fucking moron and I hope you’ve been sterilised).

Add the potatoes and simmer for another twenty-five minutes.  Remove the potatoes from the pan using a slotted spoon, add the milk and slowly bring to the boil.  Now, here’s where things get a bit tricksy.

One of the most common modern additions to Cullen Skink is double cream.  You’re not a fuckwit, you’re not going to add this.  No sir.  To thicken this soup you’ll need one of your ingredients - the more experienced cooks are already going “ah-hah!” whilst the idiot brigade are going “der?”  To thicken the soup, you’ll need to break up the potatoes.  Now, how thick you want it depends on how broken you want your potatoes.  Want a thin soup?  Leave them mostly intact.  Want a soup as dense as a Valley Girl, then you mash those tatties.  Either way, do not forget to add the butter to the soup as you’re adding the potatoes.

After you’ve added your tatties, add the fish - not the skin, you’ll need that to run around the house terrifying your children with - and heat through.  Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly.  Ladle into warmed bowls (unless you’re a cheap cunt from Bristol and insist on serving soup in cold bowls).  If you’re being a wanky prick sprinkle on your chives, if not, garnish with a wee dusting of black pepper and serve!",2022-05-01,

Ireland AND dairy AND fertiliser,qkp6c5,New research shows 50 year binge on chemical fertilisers must end to address the climate crisis,newzealand,56,0.94,"[https://grain.org/e/6761](https://grain.org/e/6761)

Relevant to NZ because the widespread availability of synthetic fertilizer is a significant factor that allowed our dairy boom to occur.

[Between 1990 and 2015, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in NZ increased by 627](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-in-fertilisers)[%.](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-in-fertilisers)

[New Zealand also has one of the highest Synthetic N fertiliser carbon footprints per capita (tCO2e/capita) alongside Canada, Australia, Estonia (?) and Ireland.](https://grain.org/system/attachments/sources/000/006/647/original/Graph_3__2_fertilizer-map_1e.jpg)

The article notes:

&gt;Today, only around 20-30% of the synthetic N fertilisers applied to fields are converted to foods, with the rest running off into water bodies and entering the environment as pollution. Not only is this heating up the planet, but it is also destroying the ozone layer and causing a global crisis of algae blooms and oceanic “dead zones”

Which is relevant to NZ, with the state of lakes like Te Waihora and issues like whitebait extinction ([notes taken by DOC point to many commentors mentioning nitrate run off in terms of damage to white bait habitats](https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/conservation/land-and-freshwater/freshwater/report-on-whitebait-management-2018-19/notes-taken-by-doc-staff-at-12-drop-in-sessions-held-during-engagement-process.pdf)) and didymo proliferation [(this article points to high N:K ratios as a key predictor of didymo blooms](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9499-2_36))

&gt;Another key driver behind today's excessive use of N fertilisers is the ongoing decoupling of crops and livestock. A growing percentage of the world's livestock is now raised on factory farms, and feedlots that dependent on industrial animal feeds, often produced in other countries. As a result, those farms now growing feed crops utilise synthetic N fertilisers, rather than the animal manure that would have traditionally provided their fields with nitrogen

Is also relevant to our import of palm kernel extract as a winter feed.

Our entire economy is based on the availability of nitrate fertilizer, and as its price rises this will provide significant negative effects to our economy and purchasing power. As well as this, as consumers become more educated on the variety of ways that contemporary society pollutes (it's not just burning things) then our reliance on nitrate fertilizer will undermine the viability of our 'clean green' export branding, which is a significant issue when considering the rise of synthetic proteins and plant based diets.",2021-11-01,

Now that I’ve been living in New Zealand for over ten years (I’m a city dweller now) it seems the tables have turned. Irish farmers, often in response to EU regulations, have had to innovate and diversify to survive, but a sizeable chunk of NZ farmers seem frozen in time, hoping to cut a deal with the climate change timeline but without having any proposals that will help NZ meet reasonable climate change commitments without losing international reputation. When did NZ farming lose its mojo and how can it get it back?",2021-07-19,

Scotland AND milk AND price,18ezaby,"Damn you, Whittakers...",newzealand,87,0.94,"A few days ago I received my annual ""care package"" of Kiwi treats from a friend in New Zealand (we do this every year - I send her a box of stuff you can't get or pay ridiculous prices for in Aotearoa, and she likewise sends me a box of stuff we can't get here.  Tis a good trade.  I send her Macallan for her dad, and she sends me Speights and L&amp;P.  I've been told it's not the *fairest* of trades...) and this year she sent me a shoebox filled with Whittakers chocolate.  I've had Whittakers before and I'm a huge Peanut Slab and Dark Ghana fanboi but this time my mate sent me yon Oat Milk chocolate.  I'm not vegan but I do work with one, so I thought ""well, give it to Sean, ask him what he thinks"".  Gave the chocolate to the easily-startled office vegan, commanded him to try it and waited for his feedback.

New Zealand - you've done it again.  The official feedback from Sean is ""holy fuck, but that's good"".  I tried it myself and, yeah, possibly the *best* vegan chocolate I've tried.  Why the hell isn't this stuff more easily available here in Scotland?   Aren't we human beings?  Don't we yearn, and ache, and...shop?

**Motions Without Notice &amp; Debate**  
  
* Hon. David Cunliffe (Labour-New Lynn) moved *That this House recognise and celebrate the    International Day of Peace by acknowledging and working collectively to address the serious threats the international community faces in progress towards peace, including the ongoing North Korean nuclear test, the appalling civil war in Syria, large-scale displacement of refugees, re-modernisation of nuclear arsenals, and growing superpower tensions.*   
  
* Catherine Delahunty (Greens-list) moved *That this House express its support for the Women's Peace Boat to Gaza and the International Coalition of Women on that boat, including New Zealand member of Parliament Marama Davidson, as it sails to Gaza to show solidarity and support to the Palestinian people, and highlight the contributions of Palestinian women who have been central within the Palestinian struggle in Gaza and the diaspora.*   
Both motions were agreed to.  
  
**Bill Introduced**  
   
The [Electronic Interactions Reform Bill](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71037_1/electronic-interactions-reform-bill) was introduced by the Hon. Peter Dunne (United Future-Ohariu).  
  
This bill is an omnibus bill that amends a range of legislation to enable digital interactions between individuals, businesses, and government agencies, and forms part of ongoing information management and digital transformation work in the State sector.  
  
**Questions for Oral Answer**

* 2 Questions to to members were answered.  
  
&gt;METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ia i tuhi hukihuki ai i te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?   
    
&gt;[Why has she drafted the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]    
     
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.      
     
&gt;Metiria Turei: He aha ngā hua mō tēnei pire ki Te Iwi Māori?     
[What are the benefits about this bill for Māoridom?]   
   
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: The connection to whenua is fundamental to—      
Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.     
    
&gt;2.METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ngā whakamōhio tautoko kua whiwhi i a mō te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?  
  
&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.  
  
&gt;Metiria Turei: Kua whai pūrongo a ia e pā ana ki te tautoko o ērā atu pāti i te pire?  
&gt;[Has she received any reports from other parties about supporting the bill?]  
    
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: I am delighted that the Māori Party and Labour have expressed strong support for my bill. The Government still has the opportunity in the House today to ensure not one more acre of Māori land is taken without consent. I challenge it to take this opportunity and vote for my bill.

**Private Bills Debated**   
  
* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

**Member’s Bills**  
   
* Catherine Delahunty’s [Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill ]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68002_1/public-works-prohibition-of-compulsory-acquisition-of) failed 48 – 73 at first reading. The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.  
   
* Dr Shane Reti’s (National – Whangarei)[ Consumer Guarantees (Removal of Unrelated Party Lender Responsibility) Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68004_1/consumer-guarantees-removal-of-unrelated-party-lender) was read a first time with the vote being 77-44. The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

**Psephology Spotlight**   
  
**Elections Concluded**  
  
* In the Northern Territory of Australia the Labor party was returned to office after one term in opposition in a landslide. Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.   
  
-------  
  
**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

New Zealand AND dairy AND EU,voqnpa,New Zealand-produced 'feta' will have to find new name under EU free trade agreement,newzealand,159,0.98,,2022-07-01,https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/07/new-zealand-produced-feta-will-have-to-find-new-name-under-eu-free-trade-agreement.html
New Zealand AND dairy AND EU,1awogze,Why does NZ put up with payWave fees?,newzealand,231,0.94,"I’ve been out of the country for around a decade, but upon return, I’m always shocked that Kiwis are charged extra to use contactless payment.

In the UK, contactless payments have been widely adopted and are generally free for merchants, with no additional fees for contactless transactions compared to chip and PIN transactions. This is true for both debit and credit card payments. Additionally, countries such as Australia, Canada, and several European countries, including France and Germany, have also seen a reduction in contactless payment fees for merchants or have minimal costs associated with this technology. In these countries, it demonstrates that contactless payment technology can be implemented without causing undue financial burdens on merchants.

New Zealand's situation with payWave fees is not the norm globally, and it seems Visa and Mastercard have created this issue specifically in the New Zealand market. The fact that contactless payments are not more expensive for merchants worldwide suggests that there may be room for improvement in the local retail payment system.

In a 2018 report by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), it was found that ""contactless card payments are estimated to incur 10 to 20 per cent lower resource costs than a comparable contact-based card transaction"" (page 3). The RBA report can be found here: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2018/sep/the-evolution-of-payment-costs-in-australia.html.

Similarly, a European Central Bank (ECB) study in 2012 compared the costs of different payment instruments, including contactless and chip and PIN transactions. The study, titled ""The Social and Private Costs of Retail Payment Instruments,"" analysed the cost structures of various payment methods across participating European countries. The study's findings suggest that contactless payments have lower costs per transaction than chip and PIN transactions. This is mainly due to the reduced processing time and the lower likelihood of manual intervention in contactless transactions. The full report can be accessed here: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp137.pdf.

Contactless payment fees in New Zealand are not in line with international trends, and other countries have implemented contactless technology without imposing significant additional costs on merchants.

In March 2023, I wrote to Duncan Webb urging the Government and the Commerce Commission to consider further action to ensure that contactless payment technology can be implemented without additional costs to merchants and consumers—but he stopped responding.",2024-02-21,
New Zealand AND dairy AND EU,onb61d,NZ Farming - from bleeding edge to scared traditionalists,newzealand,78,0.79,"When I was growing up on a small Irish dairy farm in the 1980s the local farming newspapers and A&amp;P equivalents regularly spoke of NZ farming innovation, from animal husbandry and AI breeding programs through to business and farm management and innovative products. NZ was a place to learn how to farm. I hadn’t heard of No. 8 wire but I did know than NZ was a country that found pragmatic and creative solutions to farming without the “hanging on to traditions for their own sake” you would get regularly in Ireland. Now that I’ve been living in New Zealand for over ten years (I’m a city dweller now) it seems the tables have turned. Irish farmers, often in response to EU regulations, have had to innovate and diversify to survive, but a sizeable chunk of NZ farmers seem frozen in time, hoping to cut a deal with the climate change timeline but without having any proposals that will help NZ meet reasonable climate change commitments without losing international reputation. When did NZ farming lose its mojo and how can it get it back?",2021-07-19,
New Zealand AND dairy AND EU,661czu,A Question about Liquorice,newzealand,21,0.84,"Greetings from the Cold North,

A friend of mine is moving to New Zealand for a PhD this week, and we as his friends without thinking have given him a couple of packages of salty liquorice as a farewell gift. Now we realise we haven't checked if he'll be able to bring it with him or he will end up having to consume more than 300g of liquorice on his flight.

Knowing that the rules governing import of consumable items differ from the EU and NZ, we were wondering if the rules are such that he is not permitted to bring any: unprocessed meat, dairy, fruit, veggies, and nuts; but what about processed food in the original sealed wrapping such as sweets. Does anyone have an idea what some of those rules might be?

Thanks in advance.

tl;dr are you allowed to bring liquorice into New Zealand, if you declare it in custums and it is in the sealed original package?",2017-04-18,
New Zealand AND dairy AND EU,38u1h3,Some questions from Sweden,newzealand,63,0.81,"Hello, I am a 24 yo male from Sweden and are currently eyeing the possibility to move and work in NZ and if it works out I will try to stay (get a citizenship).

I have already read up on some information for NZ and have already notice some negatives and positives against Sweden/EU.
Sweden and NZ also have some agreements. First off both countries support a dual citizenship, which is a most for me. So here is some questions:

I do not have any real connection to NZ so the only way for me to get a citizenship is to work and live in NZ for 5+ years?

Is there any downside/responsibility for me becoming a citizen of NZ? (example being conscription or compulsory voting (like Australia))

Is the weather really that great? have looked at wellington as a possible new home, and it says that the record highest and lowest temp are +31.1 C and -1.9 C. Where I live the record highest temp is 36-37 C and record lowest is -32 C. So a normal year in Wellington is around 2-28 C over the year? If so that is amazing!

Is the housing pricing really THAT bad? 400 000 NZ dollar for a decent house. For that amount you can get a really nice house in Sweden. 

How is the renting for apartments? is it also high in cities?

How much for buying a apartment in wellington or Auckland?

How are other products? I know that video games can cost some extra. Are there any other products that are expansive? example meat, dairy products and furniture.

How easy is it to find a job in NZ? Preferably in IT (have some education + experience in that field. ""lower"" jobs in IT is fine totally fine! (call centers, IT support anything with IT really)) 

How good is the pay? saw that NZ ""only"" have 36k in GDP (PPP) while Sweden have 47k in GDP (PPP) (PPP stands for Purchasing power parity aka bang for the buck).

How is the relationship between AUS and NZ? are you free to live and work in both countries without a visa if you are either a aussie or a kiwi?

How is the education? all free including university? is the quality good?

How is the healthcare? free/quality?

Best websites for housing/renting? 

Best websites for jobhunting?

best websites for connecting with people in NZ? (as I will move to NZ as a single and only have 1 distant friend in NZ)

How is the current political situation in NZ? just link a good website if there is to much information.

How is the wild life? I saw that you only had like 3(?) dangerous spiders. Are there any sharks? Any other animal to look out for?

Any other information that you have is appreciated! Hopefully I can get some kind people to answer at least some of my questions!

If there are some questions about me or about Sweden/EU I am happy to answer them as well!

Cheers

New Zealand AND dairy AND EU,53w98x,Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill drawn from Ballot + Members Day Update,newzealand,11,0.93,"**How the Day Unfolded**  
  
**Motions Without Notice &amp; Debate**  
  
* Hon. David Cunliffe (Labour-New Lynn) moved *That this House recognise and celebrate the    International Day of Peace by acknowledging and working collectively to address the serious threats the international community faces in progress towards peace, including the ongoing North Korean nuclear test, the appalling civil war in Syria, large-scale displacement of refugees, re-modernisation of nuclear arsenals, and growing superpower tensions.*   
  
* Catherine Delahunty (Greens-list) moved *That this House express its support for the Women's Peace Boat to Gaza and the International Coalition of Women on that boat, including New Zealand member of Parliament Marama Davidson, as it sails to Gaza to show solidarity and support to the Palestinian people, and highlight the contributions of Palestinian women who have been central within the Palestinian struggle in Gaza and the diaspora.*   
Both motions were agreed to.  
  
**Bill Introduced**  
   
The [Electronic Interactions Reform Bill](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71037_1/electronic-interactions-reform-bill) was introduced by the Hon. Peter Dunne (United Future-Ohariu).  
  
This bill is an omnibus bill that amends a range of legislation to enable digital interactions between individuals, businesses, and government agencies, and forms part of ongoing information management and digital transformation work in the State sector.  
  
**Questions for Oral Answer**   
  
* [12 Questions to Ministers were answered]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/combined/HansDeb_20160921_20160921_12)  
  
* 2 Questions to to members were answered.  
  
&gt;METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ia i tuhi hukihuki ai i te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?   
    
&gt;[Why has she drafted the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]    
     
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.      
     
&gt;Metiria Turei: He aha ngā hua mō tēnei pire ki Te Iwi Māori?     
[What are the benefits about this bill for Māoridom?]   
   
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: The connection to whenua is fundamental to—      
Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.     
    
&gt;2.METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ngā whakamōhio tautoko kua whiwhi i a mō te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?  
  
&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.  
  
&gt;Metiria Turei: Kua whai pūrongo a ia e pā ana ki te tautoko o ērā atu pāti i te pire?  
&gt;[Has she received any reports from other parties about supporting the bill?]  
    
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: I am delighted that the Māori Party and Labour have expressed strong support for my bill. The Government still has the opportunity in the House today to ensure not one more acre of Māori land is taken without consent. I challenge it to take this opportunity and vote for my bill.

**Private Bills Debated**   
  
* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

**Member’s Bills**  
   
* Catherine Delahunty’s [Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill ]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68002_1/public-works-prohibition-of-compulsory-acquisition-of) failed 48 – 73 at first reading. The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.  
   
* Dr Shane Reti’s (National – Whangarei)[ Consumer Guarantees (Removal of Unrelated Party Lender Responsibility) Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68004_1/consumer-guarantees-removal-of-unrelated-party-lender) was read a first time with the vote being 77-44. The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

**Psephology Spotlight**   
  
**Elections Concluded**  
  
* In the Northern Territory of Australia the Labor party was returned to office after one term in opposition in a landslide. Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.   
  
-------  
  
**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

New Zealand AND dairy AND subsidies,18cpq75,Why do the solutions proposed to combat obesity and sugar consumption always target the consumer?,newzealand,106,0.88,"Whenever there’s a proposal to tax or untax healthy or unhealthy foods, it’s very interesting to me how heavy the focus is on the *consumer* in these situations. We want to incentivise people to buy and consume differently at their end of the issue, rather than influence suppliers and companies and manufacturers into doing things differently at a production level. 

For example, while I’m not personally in favour of subsidies, New Zealand used to have a *lot* of them. Fruit and vegetables, much of which are locally grown, would be a prime target for subsidies at a grower level and could also work on multiple axis, like solving issues around land being overused for dairy, supporting primary industry, environmentalism, etc. 

It’s been pretty well demonstrated that, while consumer choice plays a role in sugar consumption, consumer choice is hugely influenced by factors the individual can’t control, particularly around things like advertising, societal pressures leading to addiction, prevalence of the behaviour, social pressures, etc. It’s interesting to me that instead of aiming at reducing many of these negative pressures, our general direction seems to jump to punishing consumers further for choices they have been incentivised into making that we deem bad, rather than targeting the causes of that behaviour. When we did enact measures that focussed on limiting supply rather than reducing demand - i.e. smoking ban, vape shop reduction - it was met with such strong pushback the new government is now promising to unwind them. 

When I was younger I also remember a lot of campaigns around nutrition education and ensuring product labelling was informative around issues like sugar. I don’t think we did it perfectly, but what we did do seemed to have a good influence on public understanding around food contents. Maybe I’m not looking in the right places, but I’m sure I see less of this these days. This seemed to me to work with both producers and consumers - it helped make companies more honest about their food by standardising nutritional information and ensuring consumers had the ability to make informed choices. 

Why is it that taxes and punitive measures targeting the consumer end of the supply chain seem so much more preferred at the moment in New Zealand than other regulatory methods? Is it that consumers like to feel like they have an active choice in what they’re consuming, and so favour methods and discussions that give them a greater feeling of agency? Is it our negative history with subsidies that we later suffered economically to undo? Is it just that taxes are what people know and understand because it’s what they saw politicians do with smoking and alcohol? Is there genuinely an argument somewhere I’m missing that says taxes are a better way to address these problems than other methods?",2023-12-07,
New Zealand AND dairy AND subsidies,13x247,Here's a strong statement about NZ dairy exports from an old Merril Lynch boss (one of JK's old workmates),newzealand,27,0.71,"Keep in mind the TPPA while reading:
&gt;Why should the United States and the EC, who themselves are already saturated with dairy and meat products, want yet more of the same from New Zealand? The fact that it would be probably much cheaper is irrelevant - their respective powerful farm lobbies would ignore such practicalities. New Zealand's leaders are currently engaged in GATT negotiations to remove or minimize subsidies and other forms of restrictions on international agricultural trade. Much of the EC production is sold on world markets at only half, or even one-third, of its production costs. New Zealand farmers with no subsidies or government assistance receive only a quarter of the price paid to EC farmers for their milk, for example. New Zealand's dairy industry has said that the EC's politically managed agricultural system is worse than the rigidly controlled agricultural systems of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. When the November 1992 GATT preliminary agreement failed to hold up, New Zealand's government stated publicly that it would consider applying for membership in NAFTA, as it seems, erroneously, to believe this will guarantee a market share there for New Zealand's agricultural exports. In fact, New Zealand would be competing head to head with probably the United States' strongest lobby, its farm lobby, which faces little competition for New Zealand-type products from either Canada or Mexico and which would put up strong resistance to such new competition from New Zealand.

&gt;If it was more realistic, it should see that trying to sell meat and milk to the United States and the EC is like selling tea to Sri Lanka.

- M.S. Dobbs-Higginson, former Chairman of Merrill Lynch Asia-Pacific turned prolific investment banker and advisor to an Asian government (doesn't say which), several major Asian corporations and a major European bank. Writing in 1992/93, so he's probably done a lot more since then. This is all from his book *Asia-Pacific - its role in the NEW WORLD DISORDER* (yes, it really is called that). I found it in an op-shop.

Ever since I read that, the facepalm has been strong whenever I've heard talk about the TPPA benefiting our trade. I really think we're getting screwed with that deal.",2012-11-28,
New Zealand AND dairy AND subsidies,jqizt3,Socialism. Doesn't seem like such a bad idea in moderation?,newzealand,75,0.56,"I'm not an economist, hence the question; I'm an ideas man. And they're often ill-conceived... so, please bear with me before you collectively tear this one to shreds!

AFAICT, socialism is essentially the ""social ownership"" of the means of production. **I am specifically interested in exploring this concept for STAPLE FOOD PRODUCTION in New Zealand.** So... nothing to do with cooking/mixing/preserving/branding/marketing of food, only the production of raw foods; fruit, vegetables, grains, meat, dairy etc. It'd also seem sensible to extend this to some core staples that require processing e.g. flour, oil. I assume there are TONS of things to be considered that're far beyond my expertise... 

I am imagining this as a means to solve: 

* wage issues in the relevant industries (in cases where individual producers are in strife for reasons outside of their control (e.g. weather/climate) you'd need some kind of safety net in the form of a wage subsidy scheme e.g. for COURGETTE MAN)

* unnecessary outsourcing of jobs for commercial reasons (I'm sure there will still be some skill shortages, but not for stupidly solvable issues like fruit-picking)

* unnecessarily high prices of healthy staples in NZ (I understand that import/export/weather/climate would continue to have a significant impact on this, but the status quo needs improvement) 

* our heavy reliance on meat and dairy production (yes I understand that this is currently a HUGE part of our economy, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, but we MUST take steps to reduce high-intensity farming... and it would be a LOT easier for farmers to pivot to alternatives if they are a supported by the rest of the nation via the government).

* ongoing support for food producers in adapting to legislation for NZ's climate-change response, to minimise destabilisation of our food production industry.

I guess I'm imagining an almost Fonterra-like arrangement, but where Fonterra is a government ""ministry"" - with both a commercial and public service mandate, rather than purely commercial. *(Am I even talking about Socialism here?)*

Anyways... as above, there's a good chance this idea is a turd. I ask that you help me polish the turd, rather than shitting on the turd... Also bear in mind that the turd is clearly not yet fully-formed; we be prairie-dogging, if you will.

New Zealand AND dairy AND subsidies,onb61d,NZ Farming - from bleeding edge to scared traditionalists,newzealand,78,0.79,"When I was growing up on a small Irish dairy farm in the 1980s the local farming newspapers and A&amp;P equivalents regularly spoke of NZ farming innovation, from animal husbandry and AI breeding programs through to business and farm management and innovative products. NZ was a place to learn how to farm. I hadn’t heard of No. 8 wire but I did know than NZ was a country that found pragmatic and creative solutions to farming without the “hanging on to traditions for their own sake” you would get regularly in Ireland. Now that I’ve been living in New Zealand for over ten years (I’m a city dweller now) it seems the tables have turned. Irish farmers, often in response to EU regulations, have had to innovate and diversify to survive, but a sizeable chunk of NZ farmers seem frozen in time, hoping to cut a deal with the climate change timeline but without having any proposals that will help NZ meet reasonable climate change commitments without losing international reputation. When did NZ farming lose its mojo and how can it get it back?",2021-07-19,
New Zealand AND dairy AND subsidies,12jhur,I'm a professional photographer who is visiting New Zealand next month.

Looking for info from New Zealanders on various types of farming and what seasons are happening in early-mid December. I've done some research and know there is quite a bit of cattle/sheep/dairy. Being from Vermont, I have a good deal of this already. Can anyone offer any insights, resources or more in depth information on New Zealand farming?

EDIT: Thanks for all the great info and connections, guys! I have a neat idea for a farmer portrait series and a few other things. Among other stuff, I should probably photograph at least a bit of sheep farming while I'm in NZ. We have sheep here, but nothing on a scale that comes even close. ",2012-11-02,

&gt;[Why has she drafted the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]    
     
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.      
     
&gt;Metiria Turei: He aha ngā hua mō tēnei pire ki Te Iwi Māori?

Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.

&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.

&gt;[Has she received any reports from other parties about supporting the bill?]  
    
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: I am delighted that the Māori Party and Labour have expressed strong support for my bill. The Government still has the opportunity in the House today to ensure not one more acre of Māori land is taken without consent. I challenge it to take this opportunity and vote for my bill.

**Private Bills Debated**   
  
* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.  
   
* Dr Shane Reti’s (National – Whangarei)[ Consumer Guarantees (Removal of Unrelated Party Lender Responsibility) Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68004_1/consumer-guarantees-removal-of-unrelated-party-lender) was read a first time with the vote being 77-44. The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

**Psephology Spotlight**   
  
**Elections Concluded**  
  
* In the Northern Territory of Australia the Labor party was returned to office after one term in opposition in a landslide. Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.

**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

New Zealand AND milk AND price,pfrmny,New Zealand is an expensive place to live - lets save some money,newzealand,225,0.91,"The housing market is broken, the supermarkets are charging us through the nose and our wages suck. So what can we actually do?

This is a list of basic hints and tips to optimise your spending- i.e. For the most part doing things differently/being smarter about money rather than massively cutting and making yourself unhappy. Many of you will know a lot of these but I hope a number of you will pick up something new that can help you save a few dollars. Please add your own tips in the comments :)

**Shopping:**

\- Shop specials and shop seasonally - fruit and veg not in season is crazy expensive. Check what grows and when on the NZ produce website.

\- Take into account weight when you are purchasing anything. Most supermarkets have a cost per 100 grams on the label. The classic example is that the typical Cadbury chocolate is 160 - 180g while a Whittakers is 250g. When you take into account the weight you are not paying a whole lot more for the Whittakers.

\- Buy Homebrand/Pams rather than Watties/Heinz and other big brands as they are often the same/similar quality and made on the same manufacturing line. This is especially true for canned foods and many basics like cheese, milk, butter etc... However in saying so, it is not universal. As per example above we all know Cadbury doesn't have anything on Whittakers.

\- Use Asian fruit and veg stores - they are far cheaper than the main supermarkets and the quality is comparable.

\- If possible try to use PaknSave - it is considerably cheaper than other chain supermarkets and will save you 10 - 20% every shop. Use the other supermarkets for top ups or specials only.

\- Use shops like Reduced to clear and Why Knot. Best Before dates are not expiry dates and the food is still perfectly fine to eat. Often expiry dates are almost entirely arbitrary. Your eyes, nose and common sense will tell you if food is off.

\- Use cashback websites like Kiwiwallet - Shopping through these guys for example will give you 2% back on all Countdown spend and 5% on all Aliexpress purchases.

\- Speaking of Aliexpress if you are happy to wait 2 - 6 weeks, much of the tat on trademe can be found for half the price there. However make sure the store is reputable, the item has plenty of orders and high reviews.

\- If you are shopping locally, use pricespy to find the best local price.

**Vehicles:**

\- If you travel more than 10,000km a year buy a hybrid vehicle. They will often halve your fuel bill and save you literally thousands every year. These days they are just as reliable as petrol vehicles. The batteries are no longer particularly expensive to replace and are unlikely to cause you issues. However in saying so avoid purchasing hybrids that are very old (over 10 years) or that have high kms (150k's+) as batteries have limits. I recommend the 2012+ Gen 3 priuses and Toyota Aquas.

\- If you only make short trips and have a good area to charge a vehicle at your home an electric car like a Nissan Leaf is a good 10 - 15k option. Please read up about Nissan Leaf battery health before making a purchase.

\- Never purchase a vehicle on credit, always on cash. If you don't have the cash you can't afford it. If you are desperate try to top up your mortgage rather than paying the extortionate interest rates the dealers charge.

\- Use a good checklist to check out a vehicle before purchase such as the one on ChrisFix's website.

\- Do not skip servicing because you are lazy or to save money - big nono and will bite you ten-fold later down the line.

**Bills:**

\- Shop around. Has your broadband contract expired? Spend 20 min on the phone with retention and get a new contract for a better price - easiest $200 you will ever save. If their offer is not competitive, move on - use websites like broadbandcompare to find a better deal - this includes everything like home/car/life insurance, electricity and mobile. Doing the sums and looking over this stuff one Sunday per year can easily save you between $500 and $2000.

**Eating out:**

\- This is as obvious as it gets but... learn to cook. You will save so much money and often realise that some takeaway food is not as good as you think. Not to mention that it can be good fun and a great way to get family/kids involved. Also, lockdowns won't be hell.

\- If you eat out often use websites like Grabone and Firsttable to both try out new places and often save considerable amounts of money.

\- Coffee - If you are a sucker for a cafe bought coffee, do the maths and see how much you spend in a year. If you buy coffee 3 or more times per week, invest in a good quality coffee machine like a Breville Barista Express (or better if you can). You will make better quality coffee at home than most coffee places and the machine will pay for itself over one year. Alternatively, if you are lazy, get a pod machine. Most Nespresso pods are less than $1 each however honestly they taste better than most of the chain coffee places (but not over a good independent cafe).

Phew, I have plenty more but that should be enough for now.",2021-09-01,

Now I address that New Zealand is not some real utopia with the""land of milk and honey"". It has its own issues like the housing price, the inflation or even potential recession, the ""not so sufficient"" economy, the recent political chaos, or the gang issues etc. I am also willing to understand the current kiwis' dilemma and your desire for something better than the current. Yet you guys still maintain a relatively rational  and friendly atmosphere, unlike some other countries which are plagued by the polarising politics and more and more frequent dogwhistle arguments. One thing is sure that you guys do love complaints, but rational and constructive complaints which could turn into the eagerness and motivation for change and reform. 

Overall, my experience in New Zealand was one of the most memorable and positive of my life. I was struck by the natural beauty and the warm, welcoming people. While there are certainly challenges and troubling dilemma, it's clear that Kiwis are potentially eagar to change.

Recently New Zealand dairy farmers have been going through tough times and falling milk prices are having huge effects on the sustainability of this industry &amp; it seems like the golden era of New Zealand dairy farming is ending. Farmers are losing livelihoods, employers can no longer employ people, new farmers are finding basically impossible to get jobs in the industry (correct me if I'm wrong). 

All these farmers have huge expanses of land that are going unused or being sold to survive, as well as being sold to international investors who have money to buy up this land from New Zealanders who can no longer sustain it. So I was just thinking since we have so many New Zealanders losing jobs and livelihoods, why don't they take advantage of the land, the resources they have and start producing either Recreational, Medical or Industrail Cannabis/Hemp as a complete new industry to get into or to substain until dairy prices return to something that can sustain them. 

I just see the future  New Zealand kicking it self 5-10 years down the track because we have this real negative view on cannabis use, supply, production. The Cannabis industry in New Zealand could be one of the greatest and compare to Colorado in size. 

So please tell what's good &amp; what's bad when it comes to helping farmers through this tough time by making a regulated industry from cannabis. 

As well as helping farmers it means police can focus on other crime, P which is destroying people &amp; communitys (I know people personally that turn to P when cannabis is not available, it's just as sad as it sounds), creating a new ""Golden Age"" industry, just as profitable as dairy if not more. 

We are going to be kicking ourselves over all this in a few years, when it's a normal thing to have legal Cannabis. I just hope this fosters a discussion that I believe is crucial to New Zealand's future. Feel free to prove me wrong or right.

I just want the best for my country &amp; it's people.",2016-03-09,

As said before, I’ve been here a while and remember the days when the price of electricity had to go up so that it compared with what people paid overseas for electricity.
Excuse me but aren’t we entitled to enjoy the benefits of the comparative advantage of New Zealand’s geography and its ability to produce cheap electricity. No surprise that they then sold power generation to the greedies.
Play it again Sam the spin doctor. You’re not entitled to the benefits of New Zealand’s comparative advantage with its green, pleasant and abundant lands.
And saddest of all is, if you’ll forgive the metaphor, New Zealand is the land of milk and honey and yet there are many thousand kids going hungry.

New Zealand AND milk AND price,1bgqj13,Is it shit review: Twining's Everyday Black,newzealand,14,0.91,"Hi, everyone. Its me again, back with an affordable teabag review. I had meant to write one up much earlier, but I have been afflicted with the virus (I got COVID.) This time, it seriously affected my sense of smell for a few days, and thus my taste. Which, of course, rendered me useless as a budget food and drink reviewer. Now that I can smell and taste again: here it is. 

Twining’s Everyday Black, 100 bags, ordinarily $5 from Pak N Save, on special for $3.99

Today, I was finally able to do my groceries. The affliction has lifted. I longer fear spreading it to the wider public. 

Naturally, whilst I was at the supermarket, I perused the selection of available teabags. Many of you suggested trying something like PG Tips, Dilmah, or Yorkshire tea. These are all great suggestions. However, my curiousity is incurable. I've tried all these bar the first one. I know they'll be good, or at least passable. You see: I was the kid who tasted the ants once just to see what it was like. The young person who experimented with myriad substances in the name of undistilled curiousity. This insatiable desire to try new things, to have new experiences, is as much a part of me as my hands or my skin. 

Perhaps at some point, I will write something up on the teas I have tried, and do drink from time to time. But, in the name of discovery, I picked up this box. Without further ado, let's get cracking. 

Purpose: 
Why, pray tell, do we have an affordable tea from the expensive tea people? This sits above the church fundraiser price point. It's right alongside the tried and true PG Tips, the Bell tea. It costs a bit less than Yorkshire tea, and a lot less than Twining's English Breakfast. It’s no Value Brand 100 teabag pack, but it's not a premium box of tea either. It feels a bit like a millionaire wearing a hoodie and jeans. It wants to be everyone's tea. The drink we drink, or whatever the fuck you want to call it. 

For those of us in the more dire financial situations, the $3.51 between this box, and the 30 bags of Pam's nightmare fuel may be a stretch. Or not even possible. Technically, at 5 cents per bag as well, it costs the same per unit. This tea is the value of bulk buying. It's saying to you: if you can just spend a few more dollars, you too can have Twining's. You can feel like the petit bourgeois, for proletariat prices. Don't buy that bag of rice, peasant. Save it for a bigger box of better tea. Be the tea you want to see in your mug.

The invisible hand made this tea happen. The market (sometimes) provides.

Taste: 
My immediate response was: “hmm.” It smells like Twining's English Breakfast. Was I being lulled into a sense of false security, so that Twinings could raze my tastebuds and leave no survivors? Or has the nice tea just been repackaged under a nameless variety? Mysteries never cease. Until the moment of the first sip. 

The first sip came with that familiar flavour. I recognised the well balanced drink. A pleasant experience on my haggard, traumatised palate. But as I got further through this cup of tea, the tannins took hold. While that's not unexpected from Twining's, this bitterness was more pervasive. It coated my tongue, feeling like it built over the course of the drink. As I sit here writing, my tastebuds are still coated in that aftertaste. 

I think that's what sets this one apart from the expensive Twining's. It has a similar rich taste. The noticeable layer of tannins. But the latter is just so persistent. It lingers on the tongue without reprieve. It's still a good tea, I reckon. But it hits a specific flavour profile which is definitely not for everyone. Certainly not for me. While it is an Everyday Black, it's not an everyman's black. 

Purpose: 6/10 In summary, this drink doesn't quite hit the ‘tea of the people’ image I think it's trying to cultivate. The price is right, but I just feel things like PG Tips, Choysa, Dilmah, and Bell, will always be the people’s choice. 

Flavour: 5/10. God, I really don't know with this one. I feel unsophisticated for not liking it much. Like this is a form of art I just don't ""get."" My plebeian tastebuds can’t do it. Or is this just unpleasant, and not subjective? 

The lingering taste in my mouth is so bitter. It possesses an aftertaste with a power level far above 9000. My scouter is broken. I smashed it while tasting this. The base flavour of it is pretty nice, but given the choice I'd pick other options. This might be somebody's favourite. But for me: nope. 

Overall: 5.5/10.

New Zealand AND milk AND price,7whj0t,Fonterra a failure in concept and in practice,newzealand,51,0.8,"&gt;In a stunning analysis from a quarter least expected, share market analyst, Arie Dekker of First NZ Capital, reveals there have been negligible increases in dairy farmer returns in the 17 years since Fonterra was formed, despite a 108 percent increase in milk production over that time.

&gt;“Taking inflation-adjusted milk prices from just prior to Fonterra’s formation to 2017 highlights very limited improvement in the total payout received by New Zealand farmers over the last 20 years,” he said in a note to investors.

&gt;“Despite some elevation in the payout evident for periods over the last ten years, it is hard to argue that the creation of a national champion in Fonterra has led to a sustained material upwards impact on the farm gate returns received by farmers over the last 20 years.”

&gt;Essentially, what Dekker is saying, is that the amazing and unprecedented degradation of our environment, particularly our waterways, in the last 20 years, under the guise of economic imperative, all has been for nothing.

New Zealand seems to have a robust reliance on primary industries, almost exclusively set up to serve some international markets. We grow more food, farm more sheep and beef, milk more cows, harvest more timber, fish more fush, etc etc from NZ than we ever need. These products are often incredibly expensive here in nz, yet fetch minuscule prices overseas. Why do we seem to aim to serve 8billion people poorly, when we could serve 5million people incredibly well. 

Nz primary industries have made some individuals in nz and some overseas companies very rich, but the bill for the cleanup from doing too much primary industry will probably sit with the nz taxpayer.

New Zealand AND milk AND price,13x247,Here's a strong statement about NZ dairy exports from an old Merril Lynch boss (one of JK's old workmates),newzealand,27,0.67,"Keep in mind the TPPA while reading:
&gt;Why should the United States and the EC, who themselves are already saturated with dairy and meat products, want yet more of the same from New Zealand? The fact that it would be probably much cheaper is irrelevant - their respective powerful farm lobbies would ignore such practicalities. New Zealand's leaders are currently engaged in GATT negotiations to remove or minimize subsidies and other forms of restrictions on international agricultural trade. Much of the EC production is sold on world markets at only half, or even one-third, of its production costs. New Zealand farmers with no subsidies or government assistance receive only a quarter of the price paid to EC farmers for their milk, for example. New Zealand's dairy industry has said that the EC's politically managed agricultural system is worse than the rigidly controlled agricultural systems of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. When the November 1992 GATT preliminary agreement failed to hold up, New Zealand's government stated publicly that it would consider applying for membership in NAFTA, as it seems, erroneously, to believe this will guarantee a market share there for New Zealand's agricultural exports. In fact, New Zealand would be competing head to head with probably the United States' strongest lobby, its farm lobby, which faces little competition for New Zealand-type products from either Canada or Mexico and which would put up strong resistance to such new competition from New Zealand.

&gt;If it was more realistic, it should see that trying to sell meat and milk to the United States and the EC is like selling tea to Sri Lanka.

New Zealand AND milk AND price,j5xj41,Why shouldn't the OECD fund a 'Universal' Universal Basic Income using revenue from Land Tax?,newzealand,37,0.36,"**Currently: pulling numbers out of a~~n arse~~ hat**

Right now, international aid is set at an amount that appears to be pulled out of a hat. It's basically charity - charity isn't a stable or predictable income source really, it relies on the charity of the donors and that can change depending on how generous they are feeling.

Is there an evidence-based way of deciding how much aid and what form of aid, that cross-border social welfare should be at? We calculate SO SO VERY HARD on the minutiae of the dollars and cents of domestic aid i.e. social welfare. Why don't we provide the same level of scrutiny and reliability to international aid.

The signing of the UN Declaration of Human Rights naturally includes the right of children and indigenous people and less-indigenous people and older people *to not live in poverty*, at a minimum. Poverty causes crime, disease, and a lack of intelligent voting capacity that is a necessary prerequisite for a meaningful democracy.

The ***fear of natalism*** (having lots of kids) *being fueled by social welfare*, is a very large bugbear. This fear is one of the largest hurdles that any social welfare policy has to overcome, because there is the spectre of forced sterilisations in indigenous populations and those below the poverty line, in many countries with colonial legacies. 

So how about address those fears. 

**We could use a well-calculated universal land tax to fund an International Universal Basic Income for the first TWO children of every mother in EVERY country in the world** where reliable records are kept, and leave the funding of further children to domestic policy.

The short-term application of UN Declaration of Human Rights has to be balanced with its long-term application, to have some stable and fair population policy in line with carrying capacity. It must dampen the effects of natalism, without resorting to pre-21st-century final solutions.

**21st-century social welfare solutions or UBI?**

Our modern information-age technology, our ability to make computation-informed choices, our ability to keep accurate records and get and digest information, means we can more closely calculate things such as ACC levies and track the health of individual people so we can check whether our taxes and spending is being set at a fair amount. It's better than leaving it up to private providers or poorly-resourced charities to calculate their numbers or pull numbers out of a hat.

The double-edged sword of mass surveillance means we can actually do some good with knowing how much money people have and what they are spending it on. In 'Freakonomics' or 'Superfreakonomics' (one of the two), potential terrorism suspects were successfully discovered by profiling through their banking records among other things. Because WE ARE ALREADY doing this monitoring and it is no secret, we may as well apply that information-gathering to testing and monitoring and recalibrating the amounts of social welfare and taxation, instead of just using it to try to prevent March 15s and Charlie Hebdos. 

That's one approach. Another is just using the help of information-gathering and electronic transactions, to set a blanket UBI instead of a custom-tailored automated welfare system. A blanket UBI is easier for people to accept than a custom-tailored automated welfare system, because it's easier to understand and may look more transparent and fairer to the average voter currently - which is the ultimate gatekeeper at the end of the day.

TL;DR: if you can't accept computers deciding the minutiae of individualised social welfare, then a UBI is probably a good alternative.

---

**Land tax means snowballing wealth can trickle down more easily without going through loopholes offshore, and it's not new**

Let's put aside the more specific issue of the existence of intergenerational disadvantage due to colonial legacies, aside for the moment.

There is the wider phenomenon of wealthier people and/or governments in foreign (and non-foreign) cities being more able to invest money and outbid less wealthy people in investment opportunities, resulting in greater and greater concentrations of assets in the already-wealthy, and the erosion of joint ownership/sovereignty/rangatiratanga/kawanatanga of the country itself, in countries with income tax loopholes, asset tax loopholes and flexibility of private ownership of necessity-producing assets. 

Wealthy people (in mostly wealthy countries, sometimes in less wealthy countries) can more easily buy land and other assets and then control the output and where it goes, with an incomplete guarantee that their ownership trickles down to the people of the land that they're hosted on.

Land tax is a broad-based tax solution that was suggested by the previous two New Zealand Tax Working Groups, that neither National nor Labour took on board. Last election, in 2017, the Greens were also not willing to propose it then either.

---

**Further discussion of limitations and motivations**

**International aid**

Of course, with the international application of social welfare, there might be issues with inflation and corruption, and the calculation of arable land versus land set aside as nature reserves. 

Putting aside that last very important point for the moment -

(e.g. the calculation of the 'minimum rate of return' that factors into the calculation of the the amount of the land tax. The expectation that international development funds are used to raise the land's ""productivity"" to 'estimated' levels; the problem with putting a dollar value on marine reserves and forest reserves, e.g. valuing the presence of wind turbines on the Ruahine and Tararua ranges which are a minor eyesore for a small population, and the effect of renewable energy generation via migratory-fish-blocking hydroelectric dams, that have driven to extinction some fish in some places)

\- the other points are already the case. Current international aid and domestic social welfare already have issues **so it's not like we can do a lot worse with a IUBI**. 

A universal bottom line, in line with the UN Declaration of (Universal) Human Rights that our governments have signed, should incentivise good computerised record-keeping and administration, and reduce the overhead, the human error, the stigma, the marginal disincentive to work, that is associated with current means-testing and disqualification. 

To a limited extent there is a need for additional supplementary welfare, for example people with special needs. A UBI is mainly addressing the issue of the 'casualisation of the workforce', the 'future of work', and providing a fairly general minimum bottom line, and is too broad for the small number of exceptional cases involving special needs.

The more universal international UBI only solves the most basic poverty issues at a first-pass. It's still better than the more medieval social welfare system of relying on charitable donations though, even if it doesn't fully measure up to a computation-intensive information-based individualised social welfare approach.

Countries still require a leg-up to develop productive infrastructure and capital and the provision of high-quality education. For larger capital expenditure an individualised IUBI won't directly help, BUT, the increased tax revenue from the increased spending that a IUBI would help stimulate, should actually help increase the poorer countries' available infrastructure spending (assuming government competence - which could be monitored with information-age technology). They would then be less likely to be persuaded to abandon their integrity (explicitly or implicitly) by accepting foreign infrastructure loans. Why do rich countries even loan money anyway? Social welfare isn't a loan.

At the very least, an IUBI could be given to refugees, including climate refugees and those fleeing political instability caused by international policies that we in developed countries helped vote for.

**'Replacement' fear - either end of the political spectrum**

Adding in the condition that it is only the first two children, solves the criticism relating to 'replacement rate' and intergenerational population sustainability. **If countries want to fund further children, that can be left up to domestic rather than international policies.** 

So, very right-wing and very-leftwing people should both support this, as well as centrist people. There's no way that, for example, **people actually think they can remove social welfare altogether**, and **there's no way that people can enforce birth control** either (even for people with special needs). 

The simplest compromise, as I said is only to fully-subsidise two children by international decree with the IUBI, **and let the individual countries decide whether they want to subsidise any more themselves**.

**Blunting the impact of 'the invisible hand' on the global market**

Some sort of international social security is probably needed, to smooth out the effects of international market fluctuations. It is currently the case with global markets, that small changes in domestic politics can result in huge pressures in other countries. 

For example the biofuels movements maybe 10 years ago which raised the price of grains on the international market, which affected most the affordability of grains to those with the lowest incomes. If the cost of wheat or rice for example, would be usually $1, and the average non-farmer not growing their own can only afford $1, if biofuel prices rise so that the market price becomes $2, then some countries with unscrupulous governments who don't execute price controls or other export controls or have granaries or state-owned or state-regulation of food production, could permit the export of more wheat and rice, causing some of their citizens to starve or to resort to crime to feed themselves. 

There was the Bengal famine that Churchill had a part in last century, as another example of how international issues can cause starvation in communities close to the poverty line. 

And of course everyone in New Zealand remembers the catastrophic rise in the price of butter and milk powder in the past decade (/s).

And we all are quite aware of the price fluctuations in hand sanitiser and N95 face masks. Singapore actually provides a certain quota of reusable facemasks to each household on a regular basis nowadays.

**Neither extreme-left nor extreme-right**

We can let the invisible hand, i.e. people with time and money, hoard toilet paper and resell it to people who think they can resell toilet paper for a higher price later. When the bubble bursts we can let them crash.

Or instead, we can ban the sale of toilet paper altogether and allocate it to each household through state provision. 

Or, instead, we could impose some degree of regulation on the invisible hand, but still allow money to be spent and the market to function.

*Those three choices, of how to regulate asswipes,* apply more generally as well.

For countries that don't want to outright impose a rationing system for all basic necessities because people with money and time keep hoarding all the toilet paper and housing and primary education with small classroom sizes, there needs to be some level of national and international government regulation on the sale of basic life necessities. 

The means to a dignified life can hardly be freely bought and sold to the highest bidder. If we aren't going to ration them and have state allocation, countries have got to provide a minimum basic income for their purchase and have also got to regulate to ensure that the supply of those basic necessities can still be purchased with the minimum basic income.

Obviously all sensible countries choose the third ""option"", a mixed economy model where people have to make individual choices on how to spend their basic income, and a necessary prerequisite for that is to have a minimum basic income and also government regulations to ensure that that basic income can purchase a minimum necessary quantity of necessities.

It's neither an extreme-left or extreme-right position, it's a position that our more positive rolemodels all seem to be adopting.",2020-10-06,

New Zealand AND dairy AND quality,49mv50,Cannabis &amp; New Zealand's Future,newzealand,17,0.55,"Hello /r/newzealand 

First off I ask not to dismiss this as another attempt at getting cannabis legal. 

Recently New Zealand dairy farmers have been going through tough times and falling milk prices are having huge effects on the sustainability of this industry &amp; it seems like the golden era of New Zealand dairy farming is ending. Farmers are losing livelihoods, employers can no longer employ people, new farmers are finding basically impossible to get jobs in the industry (correct me if I'm wrong). 

All these farmers have huge expanses of land that are going unused or being sold to survive, as well as being sold to international investors who have money to buy up this land from New Zealanders who can no longer sustain it. So I was just thinking since we have so many New Zealanders losing jobs and livelihoods, why don't they take advantage of the land, the resources they have and start producing either Recreational, Medical or Industrail Cannabis/Hemp as a complete new industry to get into or to substain until dairy prices return to something that can sustain them. 

I just see the future  New Zealand kicking it self 5-10 years down the track because we have this real negative view on cannabis use, supply, production. The Cannabis industry in New Zealand could be one of the greatest and compare to Colorado in size. 

So please tell what's good &amp; what's bad when it comes to helping farmers through this tough time by making a regulated industry from cannabis. 

As well as helping farmers it means police can focus on other crime, P which is destroying people &amp; communitys (I know people personally that turn to P when cannabis is not available, it's just as sad as it sounds), creating a new ""Golden Age"" industry, just as profitable as dairy if not more. 

We are going to be kicking ourselves over all this in a few years, when it's a normal thing to have legal Cannabis. I just hope this fosters a discussion that I believe is crucial to New Zealand's future. Feel free to prove me wrong or right.

I just want the best for my country &amp; it's people.",2016-03-09,

&gt; Thanks for your feedback. We are sorry to hear of your experience with one of our products.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Processes and regular quality checks are in place during production, to ensure the quality of our cheese and its packaging. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Every batch of cheese used at Dairyworks is tested for texture and sensory evaluation. The development of flavour and texture depends on moisture, fat, salt and maturing conditions of the cheese. There can be variation in taste and texture within a batch and across batches of cheese.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment this has caused you and enclose a voucher to compensate you for having had this experience with one of our products.
&gt;

New Zealand AND dairy AND quality,2gtug8,Greens accused of lying about NZ Dairy Industry revisited,newzealand,3,0.48,"A while ago I submitted a link to [Investigate](http://www.investigatemagazine.co.nz/Investigate/13025/dirty-politics-greens-accused-lying-nz-dairy-industry-bulk-email/) which had reprinted an email that was circulating about The Greens. I contacted John Hart and he assured me it was a smear campaign, and I said I'd try and verify (or not ) the claims when I got time. John helpfully pointed out who was behind the email.

**Who's behind it?**  
The Opinion Partnership. John Third (Wellington businessman), Owen Jennings (former Federated Farmers president and ACT caucus member) and John Ansell (of Iwi/Kiwi fame).

**The Claims**

The talking points are terribly framed as multi choice questions, but I'll try to get to the guts of each claim.

**1. Of all major rivers in the developed world that flow through farmland, the OECD found Clutha rated 1st, the Waitaki 2nd and the Waikato 4th for cleanliness**  
True. I couldn't find the survey but Gareth Morgan of all people [wrote a nice piece using the data.](http://garethsworld.com/blog/environment/new-zealands-water-context/) He also points out the OECD data is 10 years old.  
&gt;The OECD data is interesting in that it shows the three New Zealand rivers covered (Waikato, Waitaki and Clutha) have very low levels of nitrates and relatively low levels of total phosphorous compared to major rivers in other developed countries.

&gt;Indeed the Waitaki and Clutha rivers have the lowest and second lowest nitrate levels of any of the 98 rivers reported on. The Waikato has the fourth lowest level of nitrates. Furthermore the differences between our rivers with levels of around 0.02mgN/litre and those with some of the highest nitrate levels, such as France’s Seine at 5.6, and England’s Thames at 6.6mgN/litre, is enormous.

**2. Our three longest rivers were found to have very low levels of nitrates, and relatively low levels of total phosphorus**  
This is just a different way of framing Question 1 and is indeed true (see above)

**3. The latest Commission for the Environment report said 90% of New Zealand rivers are getting cleaner, Russel Norman lied and said water quality was getting worse**  
This one is tough and the science isn't simple, and notice the authors were talking about rivers and then accused Norman of lying about water? Using the measures of nitrate and phosphate, rivers *are* getting cleaner but that phosphate has to end up somewhere, and that's in the sediment of slow moving rivers and in lakes.

**4. Only 17 of our 1000 rivers are still rated very poor for cleanliness. But the Commissioner for the Environment reports that each one is getting cleaner**  
Couldn't find anything to back that up, but this quote from the report suggests it may be a porky . . .  
&gt; The nitrogen stress is rising year on year in nearly all regions of the country,
especially in Canterbury, Southland and Otago. While regions like Manawatū and
Waikato are predicted to have a lesser increase in nitrogen load, many rivers and lakes in these regions already have high nutrient loads and poor water quality.  
The phosphorus stress is relatively constant, but keeps accumulating in the sediment in most water bodies, particularly lakes.

**5. We use only 1.2% of our available fresh water. That’s nearly the lowest in the OECD. South Korea uses 43%**  
True, e consume just 1.2% of our total renewable water resources each year. It's high per capita (950 cubic metres) but low as an overall amount.


Annnnd, I'm outta time. The rest is really just hyperbole about fencing rivers and taxes. I'll get back to it if I have time and anyone cares.",2014-09-19,
New Zealand AND dairy AND quality,118h556,The Therapeutic Products Bill: Separating the Myths from the Facts,newzealand,126,0.84,"Therapeutic Products Bill aims to regulate therapeutic products in New Zealand, including medicines, medical devices, natural health products, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, to ensure their safety, quality, and efficacy. The Bill will replace the current Medicines Act 1981, Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985, and other minor acts like the Sunscreen Act 2022. The purpose of the Bill is to protect and improve the health of all New Zealanders by regulating therapeutic products across their lifecycle. The Bill will require therapeutic products to receive market authorisation before being imported, exported, or supplied in New Zealand. The Bill also regulates controlled activities related to therapeutic products, including manufacturing, supply, exporting, clinical trials, and advertising restrictions. A Therapeutic Products Regulator will be established to oversee these regulatory matters.

Overall this looks to me like a good bill that fixes many flaws in the current Medicines Act. The bill has been through its first reading and is now accepting submissions until the 5th of March (11 days left). I wanted to read through some of the already-made submissions to get some good ideas of where there are potential issues with the legislation, but what I saw wasn’t what I was expecting!

Currently, there are 9500 submissions, and I’ve read the first 13 pages of them - 260 submissions in all. About 2-3% of the submissions are positive towards the bill, but most are less than a paragraph, with many people complaining about their “freedoms”. One submission was simply the words “No to the bill”.

There is a huge amount of misinformation and scaremongering, and I trust that the Select Committee can filter most of it out. One common misconception I noticed was people arguing that supplements (natural or otherwise) are proactive, preventative, fight sickness/disease, and/or always safe; therefore, they should have no regulation. Of course, this isn’t true, but maybe MPs will believe it if enough people repeat it. Looking at the science, most reviews investigating the use of supplements to reduce the risk of chronic diseases have shown little to no benefit, and some studies have also suggested possible risks associated with certain supplements. Here’s what I found:

[Effects of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions on Cardiovascular Outcomes](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-0341) (2019):

*“Use of omega-3 LC-PUFA and folate supplementation could reduce risk for some cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Combined calcium plus vitamin D might increase risk for stroke.”*

[Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for CVD Prevention and Treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718345601?via%3Dihub) (2018):

*“Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks.”*

[Vitamin and Mineral Supplements for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447) (2022):

*“Vitamin and mineral supplementation was associated with little or no benefit in preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and death, with the exception of a small benefit for cancer incidence with multivitamin use. Beta carotene was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and other harmful outcomes in persons at high risk of lung cancer.”*

[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NUTRACEUTICALS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380172/) (2017):

*""However, they are not necessarily safe for everybody. Like regular drugs, supplements with active ingredients that provide a physiological or pharmacological effect are likely to also cause adverse effects in susceptible individuals. More attention to adverse effects and potential interactions is needed in order to avoid serious medical outcomes.""*

For the most part, multivitamins just create 'very expensive yellow urine' at best or, at worst, cause some harm. The media has reported that the supplements industry in NZ is worth over $2 billion. That’s a lot of money for products that do very little for the general population. So when I read people’s submissions saying they have been using supplements for their health for decades, it sadly shows they have been scammed for a long time. Here’s just one example: *“I have used health supplements almost daily such as vitamin C, D as well as zinc and ashwaganda for over two decades now.”* This isn’t evidence of the need for less regulation, as they suggest, but quite the opposite.

Filtering out the obviously crap submissions and duplicates, I have created a list of claims from submissions that could do with debunking.

*“What this suggests is that pharmacists are able to sell ingredients for highly addictive drugs and shop assistants can reccomend highly damaging drugs and ingredients that havent met saftey standards.”*

Wong-Tung, who is married to National MP Judith Collins, is a former director of Oravida Limited.


The delinquent mining company is part of a bigger web of companies all directed and owned by the same Oravida crew.  Eg, [NZG Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/1814679/directors) is owned by [NZG 2010 Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3112805/directors) which has the same directors. In turn, NZG 2010 Ltd is owned by [Kauri NZ Investment Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2368431/directors) which is owned by [Kauri NZ Trustee Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2368430/directors) which is owned by [JW Blackwell Holdings Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/7045549/shareholdings). All the directors are some variation of the above. Amazingly, DOC signed off on them leaving the landscape in this state.

Another of the associated companies is [Kauri Ruakaka Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/7045549/shareholdings), the company which caused a national fuel crisis by [indiscriminately digging up the ground in Northland](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/398917/fuel-pipeline-rupture-inquiry-tells-companies-to-invest-in-infrastructure) looking for swamp kauri to export to China. Swamp kauri is [found in mud]( https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/swamp-kauri/). 

Through an [allegedly torturous process](https://fmacskasy.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/doing-the-business-with-john-key-heres-how-part-rua/) many of the Oravida directors are also associated with the Shanghai Pengxin buy-out of [Crafar farms](https://www.interest.co.nz/news/41351/exclusive-nzs-biggest-dairy-farmer-allows-calves-starve-death-update-6) (now [Theland](https://farmersweekly.co.nz/section/dairy/view/more-fresh-milk-flying-to-china)), which is one of the biggest dairy farm groups in NZ. And of course Judith Collins herself was neck deep in the [Oravida dairy milk scandal](https://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/timeline-judith-collins-and-oravida-2014050512). In winter, cows often [produce mud]( https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/114607024/cows-in-mud-new-images-stir-up-cropping-concerns-once-more).
Is anyone else noticing a pattern here? 

I don't mean the corruption, that’s not news. I mean the mud.

**The Wilberforces**

To understand the mud connection we have to go back to the late 1970s. One of New Zealand's most respected writers is [Maurice Gee](https://www.read-nz.org/writer/gee-maurice/). He mainly writes realistic novels full of observation on NZ. In 1979 he wrote *[Under the Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain)*, and I think he was trying to warn us of what was to come.

This story features the Wilberforces, 

&gt;a family of slimy, slug-like beasts who could take on human form. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain_\(miniseries\)).

They pretend to be a normal human husband, wife, etc but this is just shape-changing. Their true form is very different. Here is [a 1981 dramatization of one of them changing](https://teara.govt.nz/en/video/45704/under-the-mountain).

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain_\(film\)#Characters), their modus operandi as as follows:

&gt;A race of symbiotic organisms consisting of a slug-like brain (roughly twice the mass of an adult human) and a large worm like body the size of an aircraft carrier. According to the account given to the twins by Mr. Jones, the Wilberforces originated millions of years ago on a world consisting of **seas of mud** which nourished the worm organisms. 

&gt;Threatened with extinction, the Wilberforces resolved themselves to conquering other worlds, **using their technology to reform other planets' surfaces into mud** in order to thrive and breed. When they had finished using a planet's resources, no life remained on that world.

**Conclusion**

It seems pretty obvious that Judith Collins and David Wong-Tung are actually not human. They are Wilberforces, as are their cronies. That would explain what they are doing leaving an enormous mud hole in Conservation land, and it would explain their appetite for destroying our country.


Circumstantial evidence supports this too. Wilberforces create a network of [portals through the mud](https://youtu.be/GIiDQauIapo?t=33). Last year, Judith Collins and David Wong Tung suddenly decided to sue some random people for a [2011 landslide]( https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/113575823/nationals-judith-collins-sues-nelson-council-residents-over-2011-slip) which involved a lot of mud coming down near one of their rentals. The people they were suing expressed confusion, but this lawsuit could well be an attempt to cover up the fact that it was caused by a portal Collins and Wong Tung had tunnelled through the mud, for faster travel when they are in their non-human forms. Also, in *Under the Mountain*, Wilberforce headquarters are in Takapuna, which is just two letters away from Papakura, Judith Collins’ electorate!

The more I think about it, the more it all makes sense.

New Zealand AND dairy AND quality,38u1h3,Some questions from Sweden,newzealand,63,0.81,"Hello, I am a 24 yo male from Sweden and are currently eyeing the possibility to move and work in NZ and if it works out I will try to stay (get a citizenship).

I have already read up on some information for NZ and have already notice some negatives and positives against Sweden/EU.
Sweden and NZ also have some agreements. First off both countries support a dual citizenship, which is a most for me. So here is some questions:

I do not have any real connection to NZ so the only way for me to get a citizenship is to work and live in NZ for 5+ years?

Is there any downside/responsibility for me becoming a citizen of NZ? (example being conscription or compulsory voting (like Australia))

Is the weather really that great? have looked at wellington as a possible new home, and it says that the record highest and lowest temp are +31.1 C and -1.9 C. Where I live the record highest temp is 36-37 C and record lowest is -32 C. So a normal year in Wellington is around 2-28 C over the year? If so that is amazing!

Is the housing pricing really THAT bad? 400 000 NZ dollar for a decent house. For that amount you can get a really nice house in Sweden. 

How is the renting for apartments? is it also high in cities?

How much for buying a apartment in wellington or Auckland?

How are other products? I know that video games can cost some extra. Are there any other products that are expansive? example meat, dairy products and furniture.

How easy is it to find a job in NZ? Preferably in IT (have some education + experience in that field. ""lower"" jobs in IT is fine totally fine! (call centers, IT support anything with IT really)) 

How good is the pay? saw that NZ ""only"" have 36k in GDP (PPP) while Sweden have 47k in GDP (PPP) (PPP stands for Purchasing power parity aka bang for the buck).

How is the relationship between AUS and NZ? are you free to live and work in both countries without a visa if you are either a aussie or a kiwi?

How is the education? all free including university? is the quality good?

How is the healthcare? free/quality?

Best websites for housing/renting? 

Best websites for jobhunting?

best websites for connecting with people in NZ? (as I will move to NZ as a single and only have 1 distant friend in NZ)

How is the current political situation in NZ? just link a good website if there is to much information.

How is the wild life? I saw that you only had like 3(?) dangerous spiders. Are there any sharks? Any other animal to look out for?

Any other information that you have is appreciated! Hopefully I can get some kind people to answer at least some of my questions!

If there are some questions about me or about Sweden/EU I am happy to answer them as well!

Cheers

New Zealand AND dairy AND fertiliser,qkp6c5,New research shows 50 year binge on chemical fertilisers must end to address the climate crisis,newzealand,56,0.94,"[https://grain.org/e/6761](https://grain.org/e/6761)

Relevant to NZ because the widespread availability of synthetic fertilizer is a significant factor that allowed our dairy boom to occur.

[Between 1990 and 2015, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in NZ increased by 627](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-in-fertilisers)[%.](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-in-fertilisers)

[New Zealand also has one of the highest Synthetic N fertiliser carbon footprints per capita (tCO2e/capita) alongside Canada, Australia, Estonia (?) and Ireland.](https://grain.org/system/attachments/sources/000/006/647/original/Graph_3__2_fertilizer-map_1e.jpg)

The article notes:

&gt;Today, only around 20-30% of the synthetic N fertilisers applied to fields are converted to foods, with the rest running off into water bodies and entering the environment as pollution. Not only is this heating up the planet, but it is also destroying the ozone layer and causing a global crisis of algae blooms and oceanic “dead zones”

Which is relevant to NZ, with the state of lakes like Te Waihora and issues like whitebait extinction ([notes taken by DOC point to many commentors mentioning nitrate run off in terms of damage to white bait habitats](https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/conservation/land-and-freshwater/freshwater/report-on-whitebait-management-2018-19/notes-taken-by-doc-staff-at-12-drop-in-sessions-held-during-engagement-process.pdf)) and didymo proliferation [(this article points to high N:K ratios as a key predictor of didymo blooms](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9499-2_36))

&gt;Another key driver behind today's excessive use of N fertilisers is the ongoing decoupling of crops and livestock. A growing percentage of the world's livestock is now raised on factory farms, and feedlots that dependent on industrial animal feeds, often produced in other countries. As a result, those farms now growing feed crops utilise synthetic N fertilisers, rather than the animal manure that would have traditionally provided their fields with nitrogen

Is also relevant to our import of palm kernel extract as a winter feed.

Our entire economy is based on the availability of nitrate fertilizer, and as its price rises this will provide significant negative effects to our economy and purchasing power. As well as this, as consumers become more educated on the variety of ways that contemporary society pollutes (it's not just burning things) then our reliance on nitrate fertilizer will undermine the viability of our 'clean green' export branding, which is a significant issue when considering the rise of synthetic proteins and plant based diets.",2021-11-01,

Horrific animal abuse on the rise
Giant South Island dairy farm-owning company MilkPride Ltd has changed its plea to guilty in relation to animal cruelty charges laid by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
MilkPride had paid $9 million for the farm's stock and plant but in a little over a year the dairy herds it was carrying were in such poor condition the stock value had dropped to $2m.

The strategy, which sets out a high level framework for New Zealand's animal welfare legislation and policy, has been launched ahead of the proposed new Animal Welfare Act.
Auckland lawyer Anita Killeen wrote in last month's New Zealand Law Journal that a decade ago crimes against animals were not viewed as very important and did not deserve punishment in the same way other crimes did.

But she said a February High Court decision in which a home detention order for a farmer who broke the tails of 115 cows with a steel pipe was quashed and substituted with two years' jail, showed a shift in the value society placed on the punishment of such crimes.

""It responds to Parliament's view that cruelty to animals is abhorrent to society and its clear intention through the unanimous passage of the Animal Welfare Amendment Act 2010 to ensure that animal cruelty is to be treated seriously by the courts,"" she said.

Horror home uncovered

It was revealed this week that clients at Parklands were forced to live in crowded, dirty conditions surrounded by more than 35 small dogs, were fed inadequate food, neglected by untrained staff, provided with no meaningful activities and denied access to their own money.

In perhaps the worst example of abuse, a teenage boy who was unable to talk was regularly left unattended in a paddock to eat grass ""like an animal"".
Residents were abused by the ""bullying"" owners - Linnaire and Neil Joslin - for up to 10 years, living in fear of being beaten or sworn at if they spoke out.

The Ministry of Health confirmed yesterday it had no plans to assess how a lack of oversight at Parklands, a former home for the intellectually disabled in South Auckland that was shut down in September, allowed its owners and staff to mistreat residents for more than 10 years.

New Zealand AND dairy AND grass,ur5vv6,Greenies bashing of Agriculture ... is it right?,newzealand,53,0.24,"I have been thinking that the way New Zealand cattle is raised, is mostly on green grass pastures, compared to the usual intensive farming done elsewhere.

I believe that the amount hectares we have for cattle, should go a long way to counteract the short-term impact of methane (stays in the atmosphere less than CO2).

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,b8adw5,Capital Gains Tax - Taxing Middle New Zealand,newzealand,154,0.33,"It is not often that I voice my opinions online.

&amp;#x200B;

I would however, like to encourage people to submit their own thoughts to Labour and NZ First with regards to the Capital Gains Tax and the recommendations put forward by the Tax Working Group.

&amp;#x200B;

*EDIT:*  
*I own no income generating assets.*

*I own no rental properties.*

*I own no shares anymore (not for quite a long time) - which I purchased while working on a low wage/salary.*

*I own no active businesses.*

&amp;#x200B;

while you may support the Capital Gains Tax on paper, please also consider the wider ramifications.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you a small-business owner? **Claim costs for working at your home office**? Your house will be hit by the CGT.

***EDIT***\*: Only if you claim deductions will your house be taxed (I thought this was already clear). Therefore no one will claim their expenses anymore because they don't want their home to be taxed.\*

&amp;#x200B;

Own any shares and plan to sell them? - You'll pay CGT. Keeping in mind that this would be on-top-of any paid dividends; which are already taxed.

&amp;#x200B;

...and that only scratches the surface of some of the proposed changes.In either case, you may still think that the recommendations are good.

&amp;#x200B;

But, consider if you will the following:

\*Tax on shares = less investors willing to purchase shares, potentially resulting in a weaker dollar and a weaker economy.

&amp;#x200B;

A weaker dollar means everything that we import costs more - and there is a great-deal that we import. Exporters like dairy farmers &amp; timber producers would love a weaker dollar, but the majority of us would not.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Tax on small-businesses = less successful businesses and less willing to take on the risk of increased costs associated with starting up a business.

&amp;#x200B;

\*CGT on properties = less investors buying properties = less rentals available = more folk struggling in an already hard market. As an example, in basically any part of the country - look at the amount of homes available for sale versus those available to rent.

More importantly, search online for stories from real-people and how hard finding a rental has been for them. The sad reality is that a lot of folk are struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember the point of the CGT put forward by the Tax Working Group - the money raised by it is supposed to support New Zealanders who need it the most. How will the government manage the money?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very afraid of some of these changes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is an example of government spending:**

The Contestable Electrical Fund - Don't know about it? It basically co-funds companies for buying electric vehicles and the like.

Foodstuffs (NZ) Ltd - granted $500,000 of funding for Electric grocery delivery vans. They own 53% of the grocery market in NZ. Is it fair that taxpayer money is spent in this way?

Here is a full-list of the approved funding:

&amp;#x200B;

Do you trust the government to do what is right, should this CGT proceed? Can they be trusted with vast amounts of cash, or will it be mishandled?

&amp;#x200B;

Please, consider placing a submission to the coalition government to voice both your concerns as well as any part of the recommendation that you agree with.

Whether booby calves or heifers, all animals are essential to running the farm and so it's only a small percentage of cowboys in the industry that actually demonstrate this negligence towards stock. Don't let the sensationalism get to your head; it will be a fair argument when these animal rights groups conduct a full audit of every single dairy unit in the country, and see how the majority of farmers actually treat their stock. Don't believe the selective, sensationalist ""facts"" shown by the media to be the truth. Farmers will put the wellbeing of their stock above their own wellbeing, and find it as upsetting as anyone else when stock are in harms way. If you're feeling upset and unsure about the issue, go visit a local dairy farm, and ask the farmer if you can help out for the day; you'll get a great insight into what really goes on.

Edit: It's also important to note that the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) who regulate farming in New Zealand have been stupendously slow to act on this; especially as this footage is supposedly over two months old. This is disappointing and talking to other farming mates just now, it's pretty fucking disgusting. From what I'm seeing through the internet and from talking to people now, it seems the dairy community (and the wider agricultural community as a whole) are fairly embarrassed and disgusted by the whole matter.

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,49mv50,Cannabis &amp; New Zealand's Future,newzealand,17,0.56,"Hello /r/newzealand 

First off I ask not to dismiss this as another attempt at getting cannabis legal. 

Recently New Zealand dairy farmers have been going through tough times and falling milk prices are having huge effects on the sustainability of this industry &amp; it seems like the golden era of New Zealand dairy farming is ending. Farmers are losing livelihoods, employers can no longer employ people, new farmers are finding basically impossible to get jobs in the industry (correct me if I'm wrong). 

All these farmers have huge expanses of land that are going unused or being sold to survive, as well as being sold to international investors who have money to buy up this land from New Zealanders who can no longer sustain it. So I was just thinking since we have so many New Zealanders losing jobs and livelihoods, why don't they take advantage of the land, the resources they have and start producing either Recreational, Medical or Industrail Cannabis/Hemp as a complete new industry to get into or to substain until dairy prices return to something that can sustain them. 

I just see the future  New Zealand kicking it self 5-10 years down the track because we have this real negative view on cannabis use, supply, production. The Cannabis industry in New Zealand could be one of the greatest and compare to Colorado in size. 

So please tell what's good &amp; what's bad when it comes to helping farmers through this tough time by making a regulated industry from cannabis. 

As well as helping farmers it means police can focus on other crime, P which is destroying people &amp; communitys (I know people personally that turn to P when cannabis is not available, it's just as sad as it sounds), creating a new ""Golden Age"" industry, just as profitable as dairy if not more.

I hadn’t heard of No. 8 wire but I did know than NZ was a country that found pragmatic and creative solutions to farming without the “hanging on to traditions for their own sake” you would get regularly in Ireland. Now that I’ve been living in New Zealand for over ten years (I’m a city dweller now) it seems the tables have turned. Irish farmers, often in response to EU regulations, have had to innovate and diversify to survive, but a sizeable chunk of NZ farmers seem frozen in time, hoping to cut a deal with the climate change timeline but without having any proposals that will help NZ meet reasonable climate change commitments without losing international reputation.

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,13x247,Here's a strong statement about NZ dairy exports from an old Merril Lynch boss (one of JK's old workmates),newzealand,27,0.68,"Keep in mind the TPPA while reading:
&gt;Why should the United States and the EC, who themselves are already saturated with dairy and meat products, want yet more of the same from New Zealand? The fact that it would be probably much cheaper is irrelevant - their respective powerful farm lobbies would ignore such practicalities. New Zealand's leaders are currently engaged in GATT negotiations to remove or minimize subsidies and other forms of restrictions on international agricultural trade. Much of the EC production is sold on world markets at only half, or even one-third, of its production costs. New Zealand farmers with no subsidies or government assistance receive only a quarter of the price paid to EC farmers for their milk, for example. New Zealand's dairy industry has said that the EC's politically managed agricultural system is worse than the rigidly controlled agricultural systems of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. When the November 1992 GATT preliminary agreement failed to hold up, New Zealand's government stated publicly that it would consider applying for membership in NAFTA, as it seems, erroneously, to believe this will guarantee a market share there for New Zealand's agricultural exports. In fact, New Zealand would be competing head to head with probably the United States' strongest lobby, its farm lobby, which faces little competition for New Zealand-type products from either Canada or Mexico and which would put up strong resistance to such new competition from New Zealand.

&gt;If it was more realistic, it should see that trying to sell meat and milk to the United States and the EC is like selling tea to Sri Lanka.

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,5zwurd,Is factory farming a problem in New Zealand?,newzealand,12,0.53,"Hi all.

I've been reading [some papers](http://faculty.smu.edu/jkazez/animal%20rights/norcross-4.pdf) about animal rights recently, about animal protectionism and about veganism generally, and I'm starting to feel persuaded by the arguments that defend them. I've accepted that factory farming is a dreadful way to get meat out of animals, and that free range is a much nicer, more ethical alternative (though killing animals at all is still a sad reality of nature).

Anyway, NZ is generally thought of as a pretty green place (for the moment at least), with rolling hills and lots of farmland and plenty of pastures to accommodate ethical farming practices. But in spite of our healthy green image, how prevalent is factory farming in NZ? 

I did hear there was a 'scandal' some years ago about large dairy companies adopting factory-farming techniques, and then there was a recent Seven Sharp segment about the mistreatment of animals on this one particular farmer's property, but generally I haven't heard much about poor farming practices, as far as animals are concerned. Maybe I've been living under a rock, but is factory farming still pretty absent from New Zealand?

It isn't really the sort of thing that's meant to be in the public eye, I know, which is why I probably wouldn't know about it if it exists. There's also very little on the web about it too, at least pertaining to NZ.",2017-03-17,
New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,7whj0t,Fonterra a failure in concept and in practice,newzealand,51,0.8,"&gt;In a stunning analysis from a quarter least expected, share market analyst, Arie Dekker of First NZ Capital, reveals there have been negligible increases in dairy farmer returns in the 17 years since Fonterra was formed, despite a 108 percent increase in milk production over that time.

&gt;“Taking inflation-adjusted milk prices from just prior to Fonterra’s formation to 2017 highlights very limited improvement in the total payout received by New Zealand farmers over the last 20 years,” he said in a note to investors.

&gt;“Despite some elevation in the payout evident for periods over the last ten years, it is hard to argue that the creation of a national champion in Fonterra has led to a sustained material upwards impact on the farm gate returns received by farmers over the last 20 years.”

&gt;Essentially, what Dekker is saying, is that the amazing and unprecedented degradation of our environment, particularly our waterways, in the last 20 years, under the guise of economic imperative, all has been for nothing.

Horrific animal abuse on the rise
Giant South Island dairy farm-owning company MilkPride Ltd has changed its plea to guilty in relation to animal cruelty charges laid by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
MilkPride had paid $9 million for the farm's stock and plant but in a little over a year the dairy herds it was carrying were in such poor condition the stock value had dropped to $2m.

The strategy, which sets out a high level framework for New Zealand's animal welfare legislation and policy, has been launched ahead of the proposed new Animal Welfare Act.
Auckland lawyer Anita Killeen wrote in last month's New Zealand Law Journal that a decade ago crimes against animals were not viewed as very important and did not deserve punishment in the same way other crimes did.

But she said a February High Court decision in which a home detention order for a farmer who broke the tails of 115 cows with a steel pipe was quashed and substituted with two years' jail, showed a shift in the value society placed on the punishment of such crimes.

""It responds to Parliament's view that cruelty to animals is abhorrent to society and its clear intention through the unanimous passage of the Animal Welfare Amendment Act 2010 to ensure that animal cruelty is to be treated seriously by the courts,"" she said.

Horror home uncovered

It was revealed this week that clients at Parklands were forced to live in crowded, dirty conditions surrounded by more than 35 small dogs, were fed inadequate food, neglected by untrained staff, provided with no meaningful activities and denied access to their own money.

In perhaps the worst example of abuse, a teenage boy who was unable to talk was regularly left unattended in a paddock to eat grass ""like an animal"".
Residents were abused by the ""bullying"" owners - Linnaire and Neil Joslin - for up to 10 years, living in fear of being beaten or sworn at if they spoke out.

The Ministry of Health confirmed yesterday it had no plans to assess how a lack of oversight at Parklands, a former home for the intellectually disabled in South Auckland that was shut down in September, allowed its owners and staff to mistreat residents for more than 10 years.

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,jqizt3,Socialism. Doesn't seem like such a bad idea in moderation?,newzealand,75,0.55,"I'm not an economist, hence the question; I'm an ideas man. And they're often ill-conceived... so, please bear with me before you collectively tear this one to shreds!

AFAICT, socialism is essentially the ""social ownership"" of the means of production. **I am specifically interested in exploring this concept for STAPLE FOOD PRODUCTION in New Zealand.** So... nothing to do with cooking/mixing/preserving/branding/marketing of food, only the production of raw foods; fruit, vegetables, grains, meat, dairy etc. It'd also seem sensible to extend this to some core staples that require processing e.g. flour, oil. I assume there are TONS of things to be considered that're far beyond my expertise... 

I am imagining this as a means to solve: 

* wage issues in the relevant industries (in cases where individual producers are in strife for reasons outside of their control (e.g. weather/climate) you'd need some kind of safety net in the form of a wage subsidy scheme e.g. for COURGETTE MAN)

* unnecessary outsourcing of jobs for commercial reasons (I'm sure there will still be some skill shortages, but not for stupidly solvable issues like fruit-picking)

* unnecessarily high prices of healthy staples in NZ (I understand that import/export/weather/climate would continue to have a significant impact on this, but the status quo needs improvement) 

* our heavy reliance on meat and dairy production (yes I understand that this is currently a HUGE part of our economy, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, but we MUST take steps to reduce high-intensity farming... and it would be a LOT easier for farmers to pivot to alternatives if they are a supported by the rest of the nation via the government).

* ongoing support for food producers in adapting to legislation for NZ's climate-change response, to minimise destabilisation of our food production industry.

I guess I'm imagining an almost Fonterra-like arrangement, but where Fonterra is a government ""ministry"" - with both a commercial and public service mandate, rather than purely commercial. *(Am I even talking about Socialism here?)*

Anyways... as above, there's a good chance this idea is a turd. I ask that you help me polish the turd, rather than shitting on the turd... Also bear in mind that the turd is clearly not yet fully-formed; we be prairie-dogging, if you will.

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,5zax43,The growing water crises in New Zealand,newzealand,38,0.64,"I know I am probably somewhat preaching to the choir. But I think these issues are so important they need to be highlighted.

On 28 July 2010, through Resolution 64/292, the United Nations General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realisation of all human rights.

That resoultion was really aimed at developing nations. I don't think it was ever envisaged that it would be an issue for NZ. But it certainly seems to be heading that way. I normally don't get caught up in such issues, but I think it is important to raise it.

There seems to be many major issues with water in this country. It is a basic human right to a clean drinking water supply. Politicians at both a national and local levels just don't seem to be giving it the appropriate urgency. we are seeing so many major troubles with water in NZ. So much is happening it is hard to keep up with it all.

with increased rainfall ostensibly from climate change. The government and local bodies just seemed to be totally unprepared for these increased storm water. Rather than properly planing and allowing for it, everything seems to get left alone then when the shit hits the fan the storm water systems fail dramatically as evidenced by the New Lynn sinkhole recently https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/watch-massive-sinkhole-swallows-west-auckland-corner-bearing-scars-tasman-tempest. This is not just an issue isolated to New Lynn, it potentially effects every community in NZ. The government and local bodies need to pull their finger out and proactively improve the storm water systems.

Another example is the current water shortages in Auckland. http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=244165 How can NZ's biggest city have such problems. why weren't these issues foreseen and planned for. There seems to be too much reacting to emergencies rather than proper planning

Yet we have water companies that seem intent on profiteering from water supply. with them exporting an incredible 9 million litres of bottled water was exported last year http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11817982 That's fine if our water supply was in order, but really with the current issues need to be sorted out before we start shipping away one of our most valuable resources.

Our rivers have fecal coliforms in them or in other words - cow shit. 
Yet the government seems to be skirting around the issue. Moving the goal posts so it is no longer an issue. http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/89718668/government-announced-new-target-to-see-90-per-cent-of-rivers-and-lakes-swimmable-by-2040 The government only seems to care about the powerful farming lobby.

Relevant passages:

&gt; **New Zealand:** Half of the country’s emissions come from the livestock sector, agricultural emissions having risen by 12% since 1990 with the doubling of its dairy herd and a 600% increase in fertilizer use. New Zealand exports 95% of its milk, largely through Fonterra, the world’s second largest dairy processor. Fonterra’s nearly 10,000 farmer shareholders incurred huge losses last year, calling into question Fonterra’s corporate structure and investment strategy. In 16 years (2003-2019), New Zealand’s on-farm debt increased by NZ$30.1 billion. In 2019, New Zealand became the first country to set GHG reduction targets for agriculture in its new Climate Law. 

.

&gt; With increased attention on the meat and dairy sector, some dairy companies such as Danone, Arla and Fonterra have pledged to reduce their absolute emissions. However, they limit these “absolute” or total reduction pledges to how they operate their offices and processing plants (scope 1 and 2), thereby excluding their supply chain emissions (Annex 2). Nestlé is an exception. It includes a scope 3 absolute reduction target, but given its highly diversified portfolio that includes coffee, cocoa, timber and so many other products, its dairy supply chain may not necessarily be included.

&gt;[Half of New Zealand’s emissions](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/final_greenhouse_gas_inventory_snapshot.pdf) come from the livestock sector, its agricultural emissions having risen by 12% since 1990. The government attributes this rise to a doubling of its dairy herd and a 600% increase in fertilizer use.29 New Zealand exports 95% of the milk it produces, largely through Fonterra, the world’s second largest dairy processor, supplying one-third of all global exports (by revenue) in 2018. In two years (2015-2017), Fonterra increased its emissions by 7% (Figure 2) due to a commensurate rise in its production. The company claims that it accounts for 20% of New Zealand’s GHG emissions “with 90% of those emissions from farms; 9% from manufacturing and 1% from distribution to markets across the world.”30  
&gt;  
&gt;In November 2019, New Zealand became the first country to set GHG reduction targets for agriculture in its new Climate Law as the following: reducing methane by 10% below 2017 levels by 2030; and by 24-47% below 2017 levels by 2050.31 For New Zealand’s methane reduction targets, how Fonterra does business matters (Box 2).  
&gt;  
&gt;***BOX 2: Fonterra’s climate targets, growth and impacts***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Fonterra has indicated that it supports the new climate law, but that reaching both the 10% methane reduction target by 2030 and the minimum 24% target by 2050 is “very ambitious” and will require further research and development. The company states that to achieve these targets and more, “the agriculture sector will need to deploy a comprehensive package of breakthrough mitigation activities, including some that are not yet technically and commercially viable.”32 Fonterra’s own climate target aims to achieve a 30% absolute reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 from 2015 GHG levels — so reductions are limited to its operations and processing facilities, even though 90% of its emissions come from its supply chain. With the climate law in place, however, the company is looking into technological fixes such as methane inhibitors to help cows burp less.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*These techno fixes, however, present their own dilemmas for the company:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“While there are some promising ideas, such as cow breeding, feeds and inhibitors, we also face some dilemmas. For example, to maximise the effectiveness of inhibitors administered through supplementary feed, the cows would need to spend more time in sheds or on feed pads being fed the special feed. This not only increases the farming costs, it is at odds with the growing consumer interest in pasture-based cows. This means our focus is on inhibitors that can be fed at milking time, and then reduce emissions while the cow is back out on the pasture.”33*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Fonterra spent the greater part of the last two decades expanding into global markets. Its export-led strategy has not only led to rising emissions, but also an economic crisis for New Zealand’s dairy producers. Fonterra’s decade long corporate expansion into China, Latin America and Australia, for instance, resulted in one-third of its suppliers unable to pay their bank debts.34 Its nearly 10,000 farmer shareholders incurred huge losses last year, calling into question Fonterra’s corporate structure and investment strategy.35*  
&gt;  
&gt;In 16 years (2003-2019), New Zealand’s on-farm debt increased by NZ$30.1 billion to total over $41 billion, according to New Zealand’s Ministry of Primary Industries.36 The ministry notes that this level of indebtedness makes implementation of New Zealand’s environmental policy much more difficult: “Financial pressures associated with this highly indebted sector may constrain the ability of financially vulnerable farms to invest and adapt to the changes associated with increased environmental and other regulatory requirements on the sector over the longer term.”37 Even as New Zealand becomes the first national government to regulate agricultural methane emissions, unless the government comes up with an economic transition plan for rural dairy producers that incentivizes less production and better pasture management, it is difficult to see how the government fulfils its climate goals.

.

&gt; Five out of 13 are actually reporting any or all of their GHG emissions. Arla, Danone, Fonterra and Nestlé seem to be the only ones doing third-party verification of all their reported emissions as per the Carbon Disclosure Project Database. Saputo has done third-party verification on only its scope 1 and 2 emissions and not its supply chain emissions. It is not clear that Friesland Campina has third-party verification in place for its reported emissions in its annual report.",2020-06-17,

New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,2gtug8,Greens accused of lying about NZ Dairy Industry revisited,newzealand,3,0.52,"A while ago I submitted a link to [Investigate](http://www.investigatemagazine.co.nz/Investigate/13025/dirty-politics-greens-accused-lying-nz-dairy-industry-bulk-email/) which had reprinted an email that was circulating about The Greens. I contacted John Hart and he assured me it was a smear campaign, and I said I'd try and verify (or not ) the claims when I got time. John helpfully pointed out who was behind the email.

**Who's behind it?**  
The Opinion Partnership. John Third (Wellington businessman), Owen Jennings (former Federated Farmers president and ACT caucus member) and John Ansell (of Iwi/Kiwi fame).

**The Claims**

The talking points are terribly framed as multi choice questions, but I'll try to get to the guts of each claim.

**1. Of all major rivers in the developed world that flow through farmland, the OECD found Clutha rated 1st, the Waitaki 2nd and the Waikato 4th for cleanliness**  
True. I couldn't find the survey but Gareth Morgan of all people [wrote a nice piece using the data.](http://garethsworld.com/blog/environment/new-zealands-water-context/) He also points out the OECD data is 10 years old.  
&gt;The OECD data is interesting in that it shows the three New Zealand rivers covered (Waikato, Waitaki and Clutha) have very low levels of nitrates and relatively low levels of total phosphorous compared to major rivers in other developed countries.

&gt;Indeed the Waitaki and Clutha rivers have the lowest and second lowest nitrate levels of any of the 98 rivers reported on. The Waikato has the fourth lowest level of nitrates. Furthermore the differences between our rivers with levels of around 0.02mgN/litre and those with some of the highest nitrate levels, such as France’s Seine at 5.6, and England’s Thames at 6.6mgN/litre, is enormous.

**2. Our three longest rivers were found to have very low levels of nitrates, and relatively low levels of total phosphorus**  
This is just a different way of framing Question 1 and is indeed true (see above)

**3. The latest Commission for the Environment report said 90% of New Zealand rivers are getting cleaner, Russel Norman lied and said water quality was getting worse**  
This one is tough and the science isn't simple, and notice the authors were talking about rivers and then accused Norman of lying about water? Using the measures of nitrate and phosphate, rivers *are* getting cleaner but that phosphate has to end up somewhere, and that's in the sediment of slow moving rivers and in lakes.

**4. Only 17 of our 1000 rivers are still rated very poor for cleanliness. But the Commissioner for the Environment reports that each one is getting cleaner**  
Couldn't find anything to back that up, but this quote from the report suggests it may be a porky . . .  
&gt; The nitrogen stress is rising year on year in nearly all regions of the country,
especially in Canterbury, Southland and Otago. While regions like Manawatū and
Waikato are predicted to have a lesser increase in nitrogen load, many rivers and lakes in these regions already have high nutrient loads and poor water quality.  
The phosphorus stress is relatively constant, but keeps accumulating in the sediment in most water bodies, particularly lakes.

**5. We use only 1.2% of our available fresh water. That’s nearly the lowest in the OECD. South Korea uses 43%**  
True, e consume just 1.2% of our total renewable water resources each year. It's high per capita (950 cubic metres) but low as an overall amount.


Annnnd, I'm outta time. The rest is really just hyperbole about fencing rivers and taxes. I'll get back to it if I have time and anyone cares.",2014-09-19,
New Zealand AND dairy AND farmers,gv3uml,"Mud Conspiracy: Judith Collins and her husband are shape-shifting aliens bent on destroying Earth. Hear me out, because this is very compelling data.",newzealand,42,0.88,"Reports were published today of [an enormous devastated area of bare clay mud](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2020/06/02/1079363/rehabilitated-conservation-mine-a-desolate-wasteland) and rock with a massive muddy hole in the middle, which has just been left on Conservation land in the beautiful [Mikonui Valley](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/west-coast/places/mikonui-river-kakapotahi-river-area/) by an unscrupulous mining company, NZG Ltd, which has managed to pull a swift one and avoid its clean-up obligations.

These reports got me thinking.

**Oravida connection and the environment**

The destructive company turns out to be directed by Judith Collins' husband and the usual Oravida crowd:

&gt;The 22-hectare site in Mikonui Valley, 31 km south of Hokitika, was mined for gold by NZG Limited. The company's four listed directors include: James Blackwell, Julia Jiyan Xu, Stone Shi, and David Wong-Tung. The first three of these directors are also directors of Oravida Limited. Wong-Tung, who is married to National MP Judith Collins, is a former director of Oravida Limited.


The delinquent mining company is part of a bigger web of companies all directed and owned by the same Oravida crew.  Eg, [NZG Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/1814679/directors) is owned by [NZG 2010 Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3112805/directors) which has the same directors. In turn, NZG 2010 Ltd is owned by [Kauri NZ Investment Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2368431/directors) which is owned by [Kauri NZ Trustee Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2368430/directors) which is owned by [JW Blackwell Holdings Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/7045549/shareholdings). All the directors are some variation of the above. Amazingly, DOC signed off on them leaving the landscape in this state.

Another of the associated companies is [Kauri Ruakaka Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/7045549/shareholdings), the company which caused a national fuel crisis by [indiscriminately digging up the ground in Northland](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/398917/fuel-pipeline-rupture-inquiry-tells-companies-to-invest-in-infrastructure) looking for swamp kauri to export to China. Swamp kauri is [found in mud]( https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/swamp-kauri/). 

Through an [allegedly torturous process](https://fmacskasy.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/doing-the-business-with-john-key-heres-how-part-rua/) many of the Oravida directors are also associated with the Shanghai Pengxin buy-out of [Crafar farms](https://www.interest.co.nz/news/41351/exclusive-nzs-biggest-dairy-farmer-allows-calves-starve-death-update-6) (now [Theland](https://farmersweekly.co.nz/section/dairy/view/more-fresh-milk-flying-to-china)), which is one of the biggest dairy farm groups in NZ. And of course Judith Collins herself was neck deep in the [Oravida dairy milk scandal](https://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/timeline-judith-collins-and-oravida-2014050512). In winter, cows often [produce mud]( https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/114607024/cows-in-mud-new-images-stir-up-cropping-concerns-once-more).
Is anyone else noticing a pattern here? 

I don't mean the corruption, that’s not news. I mean the mud.

**The Wilberforces**

To understand the mud connection we have to go back to the late 1970s. One of New Zealand's most respected writers is [Maurice Gee](https://www.read-nz.org/writer/gee-maurice/). He mainly writes realistic novels full of observation on NZ. In 1979 he wrote *[Under the Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain)*, and I think he was trying to warn us of what was to come.

This story features the Wilberforces, 

&gt;a family of slimy, slug-like beasts who could take on human form. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain_\(miniseries\)).

They pretend to be a normal human husband, wife, etc but this is just shape-changing. Their true form is very different. Here is [a 1981 dramatization of one of them changing](https://teara.govt.nz/en/video/45704/under-the-mountain).

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain_\(film\)#Characters), their modus operandi as as follows:

&gt;A race of symbiotic organisms consisting of a slug-like brain (roughly twice the mass of an adult human) and a large worm like body the size of an aircraft carrier. According to the account given to the twins by Mr. Jones, the Wilberforces originated millions of years ago on a world consisting of **seas of mud** which nourished the worm organisms. 

&gt;Threatened with extinction, the Wilberforces resolved themselves to conquering other worlds, **using their technology to reform other planets' surfaces into mud** in order to thrive and breed. When they had finished using a planet's resources, no life remained on that world.

**Conclusion**

It seems pretty obvious that Judith Collins and David Wong-Tung are actually not human. They are Wilberforces, as are their cronies. That would explain what they are doing leaving an enormous mud hole in Conservation land, and it would explain their appetite for destroying our country.


Circumstantial evidence supports this too. Wilberforces create a network of [portals through the mud](https://youtu.be/GIiDQauIapo?t=33). Last year, Judith Collins and David Wong Tung suddenly decided to sue some random people for a [2011 landslide]( https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/113575823/nationals-judith-collins-sues-nelson-council-residents-over-2011-slip) which involved a lot of mud coming down near one of their rentals. The people they were suing expressed confusion, but this lawsuit could well be an attempt to cover up the fact that it was caused by a portal Collins and Wong Tung had tunnelled through the mud, for faster travel when they are in their non-human forms. Also, in *Under the Mountain*, Wilberforce headquarters are in Takapuna, which is just two letters away from Papakura, Judith Collins’ electorate!

The more I think about it, the more it all makes sense.

&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.

Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.

&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.

* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.  
   
* Dr Shane Reti’s (National – Whangarei)[ Consumer Guarantees (Removal of Unrelated Party Lender Responsibility) Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68004_1/consumer-guarantees-removal-of-unrelated-party-lender) was read a first time with the vote being 77-44. The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.

**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

USA AND milk AND price,g55q4r,Global milk prices historically track with oil prices. How will the collapse in the oil price in America effect our dairy industry ?,newzealand,29,0.7,"The relationship between world milk price and oil price has been known for many years. This is not a loose link. It is tied to the cost of production in the USA and Europe ,which is highly dependent on oil price because the herds are managed in herd homes and fed harvested feeds which all have a significant oil price component in their cost structure. Compare NZ, in which herds are managed and largely fed in grass paddocks and are not sensitive to the change in oil price.

A low USA oil price means that the USA can produce milk more cheaply than can NZ and can out-compete NZ on the international market. With an overall reduction in demand for commodities there may be a vanishing demand for international dairy products, just as the world is now experiencing a vanishing demand for oil.

Tonight at midnight, Tuesday the 21 April 2020 Global Dairy Trade, hold their next international auction of dairy products. Tomorrow morning we will have some idea what the fallout will be. 

In most countries, dairy production is consumed locally including the USA. There are only a small number of players in the international market and NZ is a major supplier. But if costs lower in the USA producers can ramp up production in one season and produce a surplus which then has to be sold on the international market.  This happens because USA's domestic milk production is massive compared to NZ's total production.  A modest surplus can eclipse NZ's total production.. These factors could make NZ's milk production uneconomic and could destroy another major sector of NZ's overseas earnings. 

I am not an expert on any of this. I am simply aware that these factors exist. I welcome any discussion,  including correction, on this topic.",2020-04-21,

USA AND dairy AND quality,118h556,The Therapeutic Products Bill: Separating the Myths from the Facts,newzealand,126,0.84,"Therapeutic Products Bill aims to regulate therapeutic products in New Zealand, including medicines, medical devices, natural health products, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, to ensure their safety, quality, and efficacy. The Bill will replace the current Medicines Act 1981, Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985, and other minor acts like the Sunscreen Act 2022. The purpose of the Bill is to protect and improve the health of all New Zealanders by regulating therapeutic products across their lifecycle. The Bill will require therapeutic products to receive market authorisation before being imported, exported, or supplied in New Zealand. The Bill also regulates controlled activities related to therapeutic products, including manufacturing, supply, exporting, clinical trials, and advertising restrictions. A Therapeutic Products Regulator will be established to oversee these regulatory matters.

Overall this looks to me like a good bill that fixes many flaws in the current Medicines Act. The bill has been through its first reading and is now accepting submissions until the 5th of March (11 days left). I wanted to read through some of the already-made submissions to get some good ideas of where there are potential issues with the legislation, but what I saw wasn’t what I was expecting!

Currently, there are 9500 submissions, and I’ve read the first 13 pages of them - 260 submissions in all. About 2-3% of the submissions are positive towards the bill, but most are less than a paragraph, with many people complaining about their “freedoms”. One submission was simply the words “No to the bill”.

You can read all the submissions on the Parliament website at:

There is a huge amount of misinformation and scaremongering, and I trust that the Select Committee can filter most of it out. One common misconception I noticed was people arguing that supplements (natural or otherwise) are proactive, preventative, fight sickness/disease, and/or always safe; therefore, they should have no regulation. Of course, this isn’t true, but maybe MPs will believe it if enough people repeat it. Looking at the science, most reviews investigating the use of supplements to reduce the risk of chronic diseases have shown little to no benefit, and some studies have also suggested possible risks associated with certain supplements. Here’s what I found:

[Effects of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions on Cardiovascular Outcomes](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-0341) (2019):

*“Use of omega-3 LC-PUFA and folate supplementation could reduce risk for some cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Combined calcium plus vitamin D might increase risk for stroke.”*

[Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for CVD Prevention and Treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718345601?via%3Dihub) (2018):

*“Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks.”*

[Vitamin and Mineral Supplements for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447) (2022):

*“Vitamin and mineral supplementation was associated with little or no benefit in preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and death, with the exception of a small benefit for cancer incidence with multivitamin use. Beta carotene was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and other harmful outcomes in persons at high risk of lung cancer.”*

[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NUTRACEUTICALS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380172/) (2017):

*""However, they are not necessarily safe for everybody. Like regular drugs, supplements with active ingredients that provide a physiological or pharmacological effect are likely to also cause adverse effects in susceptible individuals. More attention to adverse effects and potential interactions is needed in order to avoid serious medical outcomes.""*

For the most part, multivitamins just create 'very expensive yellow urine' at best or, at worst, cause some harm. The media has reported that the supplements industry in NZ is worth over $2 billion. That’s a lot of money for products that do very little for the general population. So when I read people’s submissions saying they have been using supplements for their health for decades, it sadly shows they have been scammed for a long time. Here’s just one example: *“I have used health supplements almost daily such as vitamin C, D as well as zinc and ashwaganda for over two decades now.”* This isn’t evidence of the need for less regulation, as they suggest, but quite the opposite.

Filtering out the obviously crap submissions and duplicates, I have created a list of claims from submissions that could do with debunking.

*“What this suggests is that pharmacists are able to sell ingredients for highly addictive drugs and shop assistants can reccomend highly damaging drugs and ingredients that havent met saftey standards.”*

USA AND dairy AND grass,g55q4r,Global milk prices historically track with oil prices. How will the collapse in the oil price in America effect our dairy industry ?,newzealand,29,0.72,"The relationship between world milk price and oil price has been known for many years. This is not a loose link. It is tied to the cost of production in the USA and Europe ,which is highly dependent on oil price because the herds are managed in herd homes and fed harvested feeds which all have a significant oil price component in their cost structure. Compare NZ, in which herds are managed and largely fed in grass paddocks and are not sensitive to the change in oil price.

A low USA oil price means that the USA can produce milk more cheaply than can NZ and can out-compete NZ on the international market. With an overall reduction in demand for commodities there may be a vanishing demand for international dairy products, just as the world is now experiencing a vanishing demand for oil.

Tonight at midnight, Tuesday the 21 April 2020 Global Dairy Trade, hold their next international auction of dairy products. Tomorrow morning we will have some idea what the fallout will be. 

In most countries, dairy production is consumed locally including the USA. There are only a small number of players in the international market and NZ is a major supplier. But if costs lower in the USA producers can ramp up production in one season and produce a surplus which then has to be sold on the international market.  This happens because USA's domestic milk production is massive compared to NZ's total production.  A modest surplus can eclipse NZ's total production.. These factors could make NZ's milk production uneconomic and could destroy another major sector of NZ's overseas earnings. 

I am not an expert on any of this. I am simply aware that these factors exist. I welcome any discussion,  including correction, on this topic.",2020-04-21,

&gt;METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ia i tuhi hukihuki ai i te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?   
    
&gt;[Why has she drafted the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]    
     
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.

Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.

&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.

&gt;[Has she received any reports from other parties about supporting the bill?]  
    
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: I am delighted that the Māori Party and Labour have expressed strong support for my bill. The Government still has the opportunity in the House today to ensure not one more acre of Māori land is taken without consent. I challenge it to take this opportunity and vote for my bill.

**Private Bills Debated**   
  
* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.

The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

**Psephology Spotlight**   
  
**Elections Concluded**  
  
* In the Northern Territory of Australia the Labor party was returned to office after one term in opposition in a landslide. Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.

**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

dairy AND EU,1awogze,Why does NZ put up with payWave fees?,newzealand,231,0.94,"I’ve been out of the country for around a decade, but upon return, I’m always shocked that Kiwis are charged extra to use contactless payment.

In the UK, contactless payments have been widely adopted and are generally free for merchants, with no additional fees for contactless transactions compared to chip and PIN transactions. This is true for both debit and credit card payments. Additionally, countries such as Australia, Canada, and several European countries, including France and Germany, have also seen a reduction in contactless payment fees for merchants or have minimal costs associated with this technology. In these countries, it demonstrates that contactless payment technology can be implemented without causing undue financial burdens on merchants.

New Zealand's situation with payWave fees is not the norm globally, and it seems Visa and Mastercard have created this issue specifically in the New Zealand market. The fact that contactless payments are not more expensive for merchants worldwide suggests that there may be room for improvement in the local retail payment system.

In a 2018 report by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), it was found that ""contactless card payments are estimated to incur 10 to 20 per cent lower resource costs than a comparable contact-based card transaction"" (page 3). The RBA report can be found here: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2018/sep/the-evolution-of-payment-costs-in-australia.html.

Similarly, a European Central Bank (ECB) study in 2012 compared the costs of different payment instruments, including contactless and chip and PIN transactions. The study, titled ""The Social and Private Costs of Retail Payment Instruments,"" analysed the cost structures of various payment methods across participating European countries. The study's findings suggest that contactless payments have lower costs per transaction than chip and PIN transactions. This is mainly due to the reduced processing time and the lower likelihood of manual intervention in contactless transactions. The full report can be accessed here: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp137.pdf.

Contactless payment fees in New Zealand are not in line with international trends, and other countries have implemented contactless technology without imposing significant additional costs on merchants.

In March 2023, I wrote to Duncan Webb urging the Government and the Commerce Commission to consider further action to ensure that contactless payment technology can be implemented without additional costs to merchants and consumers—but he stopped responding.",2024-02-21,

NZ was a place to learn how to farm. I hadn’t heard of No. 8 wire but I did know than NZ was a country that found pragmatic and creative solutions to farming without the “hanging on to traditions for their own sake” you would get regularly in Ireland. Now that I’ve been living in New Zealand for over ten years (I’m a city dweller now) it seems the tables have turned. Irish farmers, often in response to EU regulations, have had to innovate and diversify to survive, but a sizeable chunk of NZ farmers seem frozen in time, hoping to cut a deal with the climate change timeline but without having any proposals that will help NZ meet reasonable climate change commitments without losing international reputation.

A friend of mine is moving to New Zealand for a PhD this week, and we as his friends without thinking have given him a couple of packages of salty liquorice as a farewell gift. Now we realise we haven't checked if he'll be able to bring it with him or he will end up having to consume more than 300g of liquorice on his flight.

Knowing that the rules governing import of consumable items differ from the EU and NZ, we were wondering if the rules are such that he is not permitted to bring any: unprocessed meat, dairy, fruit, veggies, and nuts; but what about processed food in the original sealed wrapping such as sweets. Does anyone have an idea what some of those rules might be?

Thanks in advance.

dairy AND EU,38u1h3,Some questions from Sweden,newzealand,63,0.81,"Hello, I am a 24 yo male from Sweden and are currently eyeing the possibility to move and work in NZ and if it works out I will try to stay (get a citizenship).

I have already read up on some information for NZ and have already notice some negatives and positives against Sweden/EU.
Sweden and NZ also have some agreements. First off both countries support a dual citizenship, which is a most for me. So here is some questions:

I do not have any real connection to NZ so the only way for me to get a citizenship is to work and live in NZ for 5+ years?

Is there any downside/responsibility for me becoming a citizen of NZ? (example being conscription or compulsory voting (like Australia))

Is the weather really that great? have looked at wellington as a possible new home, and it says that the record highest and lowest temp are +31.1 C and -1.9 C. Where I live the record highest temp is 36-37 C and record lowest is -32 C. So a normal year in Wellington is around 2-28 C over the year? If so that is amazing!

Is the housing pricing really THAT bad? 400 000 NZ dollar for a decent house. For that amount you can get a really nice house in Sweden. 

How is the renting for apartments? is it also high in cities?

How much for buying a apartment in wellington or Auckland?

How are other products? I know that video games can cost some extra. Are there any other products that are expansive? example meat, dairy products and furniture.

How easy is it to find a job in NZ? Preferably in IT (have some education + experience in that field. ""lower"" jobs in IT is fine totally fine! (call centers, IT support anything with IT really)) 

How good is the pay? saw that NZ ""only"" have 36k in GDP (PPP) while Sweden have 47k in GDP (PPP) (PPP stands for Purchasing power parity aka bang for the buck).

How is the relationship between AUS and NZ? are you free to live and work in both countries without a visa if you are either a aussie or a kiwi?

How is the education? all free including university? is the quality good?

How is the healthcare? free/quality?

Best websites for housing/renting? 

Best websites for jobhunting?

best websites for connecting with people in NZ? (as I will move to NZ as a single and only have 1 distant friend in NZ)

How is the current political situation in NZ? just link a good website if there is to much information.

How is the wild life? I saw that you only had like 3(?) dangerous spiders. Are there any sharks? Any other animal to look out for?

Any other information that you have is appreciated! Hopefully I can get some kind people to answer at least some of my questions!

If there are some questions about me or about Sweden/EU I am happy to answer them as well!

&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.

Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.

&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.

&gt;[Has she received any reports from other parties about supporting the bill?]  
    
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: I am delighted that the Māori Party and Labour have expressed strong support for my bill. The Government still has the opportunity in the House today to ensure not one more acre of Māori land is taken without consent. I challenge it to take this opportunity and vote for my bill.

* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.  
   
* Dr Shane Reti’s (National – Whangarei)[ Consumer Guarantees (Removal of Unrelated Party Lender Responsibility) Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68004_1/consumer-guarantees-removal-of-unrelated-party-lender) was read a first time with the vote being 77-44. The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

**Psephology Spotlight**   
  
**Elections Concluded**  
  
* In the Northern Territory of Australia the Labor party was returned to office after one term in opposition in a landslide. Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.   
  
-------  
  
**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

dairy AND subsidies,onji9s,Would you support a subsidy paid to farmers if it meant food was cheaper for kiwis?,newzealand,86,0.33,"Just a thought I've been having since last week's protests. NZ produces enough food to feed 40 million people but a lot of us can't afford to feed locally grown produce and/or dairy to our kids. I understand how we have to pay the same as the international markets do currently and that subsidizing NZ grown food would be seen as a subsidy to farmers but not how that affects our compliance with free trade agreements. If we only consume 5% of the dairy we produce why couldn't we ringfence that amount for domestic consumption and have it sold to public at cost, same with fruit and vegetables?",2021-07-19,

dairy AND subsidies,18cpq75,Why do the solutions proposed to combat obesity and sugar consumption always target the consumer?,newzealand,106,0.88,"Whenever there’s a proposal to tax or untax healthy or unhealthy foods, it’s very interesting to me how heavy the focus is on the *consumer* in these situations. We want to incentivise people to buy and consume differently at their end of the issue, rather than influence suppliers and companies and manufacturers into doing things differently at a production level. 

For example, while I’m not personally in favour of subsidies, New Zealand used to have a *lot* of them. Fruit and vegetables, much of which are locally grown, would be a prime target for subsidies at a grower level and could also work on multiple axis, like solving issues around land being overused for dairy, supporting primary industry, environmentalism, etc. 

It’s been pretty well demonstrated that, while consumer choice plays a role in sugar consumption, consumer choice is hugely influenced by factors the individual can’t control, particularly around things like advertising, societal pressures leading to addiction, prevalence of the behaviour, social pressures, etc. It’s interesting to me that instead of aiming at reducing many of these negative pressures, our general direction seems to jump to punishing consumers further for choices they have been incentivised into making that we deem bad, rather than targeting the causes of that behaviour. When we did enact measures that focussed on limiting supply rather than reducing demand - i.e. smoking ban, vape shop reduction - it was met with such strong pushback the new government is now promising to unwind them. 

When I was younger I also remember a lot of campaigns around nutrition education and ensuring product labelling was informative around issues like sugar. I don’t think we did it perfectly, but what we did do seemed to have a good influence on public understanding around food contents. Maybe I’m not looking in the right places, but I’m sure I see less of this these days. This seemed to me to work with both producers and consumers - it helped make companies more honest about their food by standardising nutritional information and ensuring consumers had the ability to make informed choices. 

Why is it that taxes and punitive measures targeting the consumer end of the supply chain seem so much more preferred at the moment in New Zealand than other regulatory methods? Is it that consumers like to feel like they have an active choice in what they’re consuming, and so favour methods and discussions that give them a greater feeling of agency? Is it our negative history with subsidies that we later suffered economically to undo? Is it just that taxes are what people know and understand because it’s what they saw politicians do with smoking and alcohol? Is there genuinely an argument somewhere I’m missing that says taxes are a better way to address these problems than other methods?",2023-12-07,
dairy AND subsidies,13x247,Here's a strong statement about NZ dairy exports from an old Merril Lynch boss (one of JK's old workmates),newzealand,27,0.7,"Keep in mind the TPPA while reading:
&gt;Why should the United States and the EC, who themselves are already saturated with dairy and meat products, want yet more of the same from New Zealand? The fact that it would be probably much cheaper is irrelevant - their respective powerful farm lobbies would ignore such practicalities. New Zealand's leaders are currently engaged in GATT negotiations to remove or minimize subsidies and other forms of restrictions on international agricultural trade. Much of the EC production is sold on world markets at only half, or even one-third, of its production costs. New Zealand farmers with no subsidies or government assistance receive only a quarter of the price paid to EC farmers for their milk, for example. New Zealand's dairy industry has said that the EC's politically managed agricultural system is worse than the rigidly controlled agricultural systems of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. When the November 1992 GATT preliminary agreement failed to hold up, New Zealand's government stated publicly that it would consider applying for membership in NAFTA, as it seems, erroneously, to believe this will guarantee a market share there for New Zealand's agricultural exports. In fact, New Zealand would be competing head to head with probably the United States' strongest lobby, its farm lobby, which faces little competition for New Zealand-type products from either Canada or Mexico and which would put up strong resistance to such new competition from New Zealand.

&gt;If it was more realistic, it should see that trying to sell meat and milk to the United States and the EC is like selling tea to Sri Lanka.

Dobbs-Higginson, former Chairman of Merrill Lynch Asia-Pacific turned prolific investment banker and advisor to an Asian government (doesn't say which), several major Asian corporations and a major European bank. Writing in 1992/93, so he's probably done a lot more since then. This is all from his book *Asia-Pacific - its role in the NEW WORLD DISORDER* (yes, it really is called that).

AFAICT, socialism is essentially the ""social ownership"" of the means of production. **I am specifically interested in exploring this concept for STAPLE FOOD PRODUCTION in New Zealand.** So... nothing to do with cooking/mixing/preserving/branding/marketing of food, only the production of raw foods; fruit, vegetables, grains, meat, dairy etc. It'd also seem sensible to extend this to some core staples that require processing e.g. flour, oil. I assume there are TONS of things to be considered that're far beyond my expertise... 

I am imagining this as a means to solve: 

* wage issues in the relevant industries (in cases where individual producers are in strife for reasons outside of their control (e.g. weather/climate) you'd need some kind of safety net in the form of a wage subsidy scheme e.g. for COURGETTE MAN)

* unnecessary outsourcing of jobs for commercial reasons (I'm sure there will still be some skill shortages, but not for stupidly solvable issues like fruit-picking)

* unnecessarily high prices of healthy staples in NZ (I understand that import/export/weather/climate would continue to have a significant impact on this, but the status quo needs improvement) 

* our heavy reliance on meat and dairy production (yes I understand that this is currently a HUGE part of our economy, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, but we MUST take steps to reduce high-intensity farming... and it would be a LOT easier for farmers to pivot to alternatives if they are a supported by the rest of the nation via the government).

* ongoing support for food producers in adapting to legislation for NZ's climate-change response, to minimise destabilisation of our food production industry.

I guess I'm imagining an almost Fonterra-like arrangement, but where Fonterra is a government ""ministry"" - with both a commercial and public service mandate, rather than purely commercial. *(Am I even talking about Socialism here?)*

Anyways... as above, there's a good chance this idea is a turd. I ask that you help me polish the turd, rather than shitting on the turd... Also bear in mind that the turd is clearly not yet fully-formed; we be prairie-dogging, if you will.

NZ was a place to learn how to farm. I hadn’t heard of No. 8 wire but I did know than NZ was a country that found pragmatic and creative solutions to farming without the “hanging on to traditions for their own sake” you would get regularly in Ireland. Now that I’ve been living in New Zealand for over ten years (I’m a city dweller now) it seems the tables have turned. Irish farmers, often in response to EU regulations, have had to innovate and diversify to survive, but a sizeable chunk of NZ farmers seem frozen in time, hoping to cut a deal with the climate change timeline but without having any proposals that will help NZ meet reasonable climate change commitments without losing international reputation.

Fooling your brain that mashed cauliflower is the same thing as potato is one thing—but the thing I was most worried about was bread. I fucking love bread, and every gluten-free bread I've tried before has been disappointments, so I will happily admit that I had a lot of preconceived notions about ""alt"" breads in general.

I couldn't dig up much info on the three brands I could find in Hamilton, other than a rather brief article on The Spinoff about gluten-free breads in general... So I did what any sane person would do and buy one of each, to see which one I like the best. I hope this is helpful to all three of you reading.

Per gram, Vogel's were the cheapest (this was a surprise to me) at 1.50¢/g, while Dovedale worked out to around 1.67¢/g, and Home St 2.33¢/g. In terms of carbs, Vogel's and Dovedale both clock in at around 1.2g per slice, while Home St clocks in at well under half a gram of carbs. These are all acceptable values for a meal of one or two slices, but most people probably shouldn't exceed that in one day for the first two brands. All are gluten and dairy free, and Home St and Dovedale are soy free; however, Dovedale is the only one that doesn't contain eggs (and therefore is vegan.)

Also to note is that Vogel's comes in a resealable pack, while the other two need to be moved to a ziplock bag.

3. Buttered then toasted on one side in a pan, and
4. Toasted on one side in extra-virgin olive oil, with avocado, cracked pepper, and sea salt.

[Dovedale, High St, Vogel's \(L-R\)](https://preview.redd.it/acxsmp5g8h181.jpg?width=3468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1826b61e338efedebe231026a0691845928d2c21)

Okay, so let's start with Dovedale:

* On its own, the first thing it hits you with is the earthy taste of psyllium husk and linseed, coupled with a robust tartness that's not unlike a sourdough bread. Unfortunately, I found the grainy and fibrous texture to be a bit off-putting, and while it had a nice chew, it didn't have the softness that I was looking for, and I found it left a little bit of a gooey film in the mouth, like you might get with some animal fats.
* Toasting helps to mask the husk and roughage somewhat, and the texture improved a lot with a softer and more glutinous and moist crumb. Unfortunately, the sourness also got turned up a lot... I *like* sourdough, but I thought that was about as much as I would take without any spread or toppings. It also took longer to crisp up than the other breads, and I would say the crispiness was average with a slightly mealy outside.
* Buttered and pan-toasted, same as before, and that little bit of fat helps to make the bread even more rehydrated. It also toasted much more nicely with butter to help it along, and added a good amount of crunch on the outside too. Sadly as far as the flavour profile goes, I would describe the combination of the elevated tang and the butter as ""rancid"".
* As avocado toast is where this bread really shines. It hits all the right notes, complimenting the grassiness of the oil, while yielding to the avocado. If I do this again, I'll probably put extra black pepper.

Next up is High Street:

* It's noticeably sweeter and more complex, with a strong malty aroma that reminds me of chestnut, coupled with subtle sourness that has a surprising amount of depth. It's spongier than the other two breads, and middle of the road in terms of moistness. The texture is still a little grainy, but far less than Dovedale's, and much more pleasant to eat on its own. The crust strongly reminded me of when you burn eggs while making an omelette and you get that very dry, papery edges, which I really didn't like.
* With a bit of browning and heating, the texture doesn't improve, and in fact the outside surface dries out in a hard and brittle way that wasn't all that pleasant. There is a stronger eggier smell, (for better or worse,) and a slightly albuminous coating in the mouth (definitely for worse.)
* The butter helps to draw out the sourness, and like with Dovedale, it also toasts better with that bit of fat in the pan. The surface is cragglier and crispier without fighting you at every bite, and it was very absorbent of every drop of butter. Still got that weird mouthfeel afterwards, though.
* All the best qualities about this bread also makes it a pretty average avo toast. It masks all the good parts of an avocado and the olive oil, and just feels like too many different instruments playing at the same time.

And finally, the Vogel's:

* If the last two were going for an artisan sourdough-style bread, then the Vogel's is going for something that's closer to a brioche-style. It's buttery, slightly sweet, and the whole thing is complemented by walnut pieces that cut through nicely, and lingers to a chocolatey finish. The crumb is finer-grained but tougher than High St, and overall the bread is shorter and less springy.
* Toasting turns down the sweetness and turns up the nuttiness. The texture gets even shorter on the outside, almost in between bread and biscuit, and is a bit too dusty and crumbly for my taste, but it's not bad overall. The toasting was really even and consistent though, something that will remain consistent for the other two methods.
* Butter brings out more of a herbal character. The texture is not as crumbly as dry toast, and in fact it seems a bit more pliable and stretchy than untoasted. This is how I often eat bread, and the Vogel's one was probably my favourite out of the three.
* This really isn't the kind of bread you make avocado toast with.
* Just a note about Vogel's, though: who is this product for? Everything about its taste tells me it's a peanut-butter-and-jam bread, not a cheese-and-onion bread. A long-term goal for a lot of people on keto or low-carb will be to retrain their palate to stop sugar cravings. If you're marketing to people who simply want to be carb-conscious, great. If your major selling point is ""keto"", where your target audience will be all about the umami and the salty, not sure what that game plan is.

Overall:

* None of these breads will come close to Nature's Fresh/Tip Top bread for making boring old egg sandwiches.
* Vogel's is the least offensive out of the lot, and probably the bread my wife will tolerate the most.
* High St is a good product with really low carbs, but I'm not sure if I can justify the price.
* I've been eating a lot of avo toast lately, so the Dovedale is staying in the fridge for now.
* Which brand will I buy when I next go shopping for bread? Not sure, honestly. For me, keto isn't a permanent thing, and if these are the ""imitations"" offered to tie me over until I reach my goal weight, I think I'll be okay going without any of these.
* On the other hand, if I had to choose one of these as my only bread for the rest of my life, I'd pick High Street. It's a compromise choice that strikes a balance between everyday bread and trying to be a bit fancy.",2021-11-24,

**Motions Without Notice &amp; Debate**  
  
* Hon. David Cunliffe (Labour-New Lynn) moved *That this House recognise and celebrate the    International Day of Peace by acknowledging and working collectively to address the serious threats the international community faces in progress towards peace, including the ongoing North Korean nuclear test, the appalling civil war in Syria, large-scale displacement of refugees, re-modernisation of nuclear arsenals, and growing superpower tensions.*   
  
* Catherine Delahunty (Greens-list) moved *That this House express its support for the Women's Peace Boat to Gaza and the International Coalition of Women on that boat, including New Zealand member of Parliament Marama Davidson, as it sails to Gaza to show solidarity and support to the Palestinian people, and highlight the contributions of Palestinian women who have been central within the Palestinian struggle in Gaza and the diaspora.*   
Both motions were agreed to.  
  
**Bill Introduced**  
   
The [Electronic Interactions Reform Bill](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71037_1/electronic-interactions-reform-bill) was introduced by the Hon. Peter Dunne (United Future-Ohariu).  
  
This bill is an omnibus bill that amends a range of legislation to enable digital interactions between individuals, businesses, and government agencies, and forms part of ongoing information management and digital transformation work in the State sector.  
  
**Questions for Oral Answer**

&gt;METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ia i tuhi hukihuki ai i te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?   
    
&gt;[Why has she drafted the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]    
     
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY (Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill): I drafted the bill because I was inspired by Patricia Grace and her whānau's fight to protect their land from confiscation under the Public Works Act for the construction of the Kāpiti Expressway. It is one of the most recent examples of how the Public Works Act has been used, time and time again, to alienate Māori from their land, including their historic struggles for Takaparawhau—Bastion Point—and Whāingaroa, the Raglan golf course.      
     
&gt;Metiria Turei: He aha ngā hua mō tēnei pire ki Te Iwi Māori?     
[What are the benefits about this bill for Māoridom?]   
   
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: The connection to whenua is fundamental to—      
Mr SPEAKER: Catherine Delahunty.    
CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just too fast, am I not? Connection to whenua is fundamental to Māori identity, but less than 5 percent of land in Aotearoa is still held in Māori ownership. It is completely unacceptable that the Public Works Act can still be used, in the 21st century, to confiscate Māori land. The Crown has a responsibility to protect Māori land for the benefit of future generations.     
    
&gt;2.METIRIA TUREI (Co-Leader—Green) to the Member in charge of the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill: He aha ngā whakamōhio tautoko kua whiwhi i a mō te Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?  
  
&gt;[What indications of support has she received for the Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill?]  
  
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: We have received huge support from Māori across the country for this bill. We took a petition around the motu and received almost 5,000 petition signatures, and at almost every consultation hui for the Government's Te Ture Whenua Māori Act reforms, the impact of the Public Works Act on Māori land was raised. Māori are calling on Parliament to pass this bill and end compulsory confiscations once and for all.  
  
&gt;Metiria Turei: Kua whai pūrongo a ia e pā ana ki te tautoko o ērā atu pāti i te pire?  
&gt;[Has she received any reports from other parties about supporting the bill?]  
    
&gt;CATHERINE DELAHUNTY: I am delighted that the Māori Party and Labour have expressed strong support for my bill. The Government still has the opportunity in the House today to ensure not one more acre of Māori land is taken without consent. I challenge it to take this opportunity and vote for my bill.

**Private Bills Debated**   
  
* The second reading of the [Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL67982_1/papawai-and-kaikokirikiri-trusts-amendment-bill) was agreed to unanimously.  This bill describes the relationship between Papawai and Kaikokirikiri Trusts Board, the Bishop of Te Upoko o Te Ika, and tangata whenua of Wairarapa. It establishes a more robust nomination process of board members; provides a fairer distribution of funds for tangata whenua of Wairarapa; and facilitates the long-term development of lands. This bill is being steered through the house by first term National MP for Wairarapa Alastair Scott.   
  
* The first reading of the [New Plymouth District Council (Waitara Lands) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL69946_1/new-plymouth-district-council-waitara-lands-bill) was agreed to and referred to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. This bill broadens the purposes for which net accumulated and future rental income and proceeds of sale of significant amounts of endowment land at Waitara can be applied. The bill is in the name of New Plymouth National MP Jonathan Young.

**Member’s Bills**  
   
* Catherine Delahunty’s [Public Works (Prohibition of Compulsory Acquisition of Māori Land) Amendment Bill ]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68002_1/public-works-prohibition-of-compulsory-acquisition-of) failed 48 – 73 at first reading. The purpose of this bill was to amend the Public Works Act 1981 to protect Māori freehold and Māori customary land from being acquired by a Minister or local authority for public works. This would mean that no Māori land can be taken without consent.  
   
* Dr Shane Reti’s (National – Whangarei)[ Consumer Guarantees (Removal of Unrelated Party Lender Responsibility) Amendment Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL68004_1/consumer-guarantees-removal-of-unrelated-party-lender) was read a first time with the vote being 77-44. The purpose of this bill is to amend the definition of supplier in the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 to exclude a lender who is an unrelated party from the definition of a supplier. The bill was referred to the Commerce Committee and is to be reported back by 31 January 2017.

**Biscuit Tin of Democracy**  
  
79 Bills were entered into the tin – it was 80 but the clerk pulled David Shearer’s (Labour - Mt Albert) bill for being too similar to a bill already voted down this year.  
 The winning bill this week was:  
   
* The [Private International Law (choice of Law in Tort) Bill]( https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/proposed-members-bills/document/51HOH_MEMBILL109_1/private-international-law-choice-of-law-in-tort-bill) in the name of Hamilton East National MP David Bennett.  
  
This bill clarifies which jurisdiction’s law is applicable in actions of tort and provides guidance to the courts on matters of characterisation. This bill also abolishes certain common law rules dealing with actionability and sets out the general rule that the applicable law will be the law of the jurisdiction in which the events constituting the tort in question occur.
  
As one may suspect David Bennett, who is an accountant and dairy farmer, did not draft the bill himself. Attorney General Chris Finlayson (National-list) drafted the bill.

**Psephology Spotlight**   
  
**Elections Concluded**  
  
* In the Northern Territory of Australia the Labor party was returned to office after one term in opposition in a landslide. Labor won 18 of 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly while the governing Country Liberal Party were reduced to a rump of 2 seats (Last election they won 16). The results mean there are more independent MLAs than Liberals with 5 independents, many of whom were formerly members for the CLP returned. The Northern Territory have fixed four year terms using optional preferential voting.  
  
* In Croatia the snap election that was called after a successful motion of no confidence yielded a surprise victory for the conservative HDZ. The People's Coalition's unexpected defeat was, among other things, attributed to the release of a confidential audio recording of former Prime Minister and coalition chairman Zoran Milanović speaking at a private meeting with Croatian war veterans. In the recording Milanović used numerous derogatory terms, calling Serbs ʽʽpitifulˮ and stating that ʽʽBosnia and Herzegovina is not a countryˮ and it is thought that these statements undermined support for the People's Coalition among minority voters. After the election Milanović announced that he would not restand for election as party president.
The HDZ, which had trailed the People's coalition in opinion polls for over two months prior to the election and was thought to be facing certain defeat, managed under its new leader, MEP Andrej Plenković to shed the image of being a corruption-engulfed right-wing party for a more Europe-oriented centrist one. Low turnout is also thought to have contributed to the unexpectedly large number of seats won by the HDZ, as their voters and supporters were expected to have a high turnout rate on election day. On the day following the election, Zoran Milanovic stated that he would not seek another term as SDP chairman. Following the conservatives' victory, the stock market reacted generally favourably to the election results.
It is considered likely that the next governing majority will be formed by a coalition of the HDZ and the centre-right Most party, which once again gained the role of kingmaker. However such a coalition would also need the support of additional parties to command a majority of seats, which is also a prerequisite for naming a Prime Minister-designate, who is given a 30-day mandate to form a government by the President. In the event of a HDZ-Most coalition government, Andrej Plenković as chairman of the HDZ is thought to be the most likely candidate to become the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia.  
  
**Upcoming Elections**  
   
 In Switzerland the latest round of national referendums will take place on the 25th of September. Three initiatives are on the ballot.   
   
* The first initiative is a popular initiative proposed by the Green Party “For a sustainable and resource-efficient economy (green economy)”     
   
  The initiative requires the Confederation, cantons and communes to ensure that the Swiss economy makes efficient use of natural resources from home and abroad and does as little harm as possible to the environment. Industry should use raw materials sparingly and ensure that it creates as little waste as possible. Waste should be recyclable and be used again as raw materials in the economic cycle. If everyone in the world were to use as many natural resources as people in Switzerland do, we would need three planets like Earth to produce the resources required. The Initiative plans to reduce this consumption by 2050 so that it does not exceed the Earth’s projected natural capacity.  
  
  The Federal Council takes the view that the target of “one Earth’s footprint by 2050” goes too far – the initiative seeks to achieve too much in too short a time. In their opinion this would require drastic economic measures and may have negative consequences for competitiveness, growth and employment.  
  
  “The Federal Council has already introduced numerous measures aimed at the efficient use of natural resources. Parliament also supports resource efficiency, but it does not want to introduce regulations that go even further. The Federal Council and Parliament therefore reject the popular initiative.”  
  
* The second concerns the retirement system known as AHV. The proposal is to raise state pensions by ten percent as they now lag behind wages and private arrangements often aren’t able to bridge this gap. The Federal Constitution stipulates that pensions must be sufficient to cover basic living expenses adequately. The increase is estimated to cost 4.1 billion francs ($5.7 billion NZD) per year and would be financed from higher salary deductions. The initiative was proposed by trade unions and opinion polling shows it is unclear which side would win with 34 percent planning to vote yes to the ‘AHV plus’ initiative, 25 percent voting no and 41 percent still undecided. The Federal Council and Parliament are encouraging a no vote on cost grounds. 
  
* The third proposal comes from the government to amend the Federal Intelligence Act.   
  
  Aimed at boosting intelligence in the face of terrorism, the changes would give the Swiss intelligence service (NDB) more powers to gather information, including the ability to monitor, record and analyze the private conversations of citizens.   
   
  The federal government is supporting the changes, saying they “provide the NDB with the modern resources it needs to fulfill its task of safeguarding the security of our country”.  
  
  The NDB will only be able to use the new measures if it complies with strict conditions, it said.  
   
  But many are against the changes, with the Socialist Party saying the new law would “open to the door to state snooping” on people’s private lives.    
    
  More information doesn’t mean more security, it feels, pointing out that many of the recent attacks have been carried out by people already known to police in some way.   
   
* In Hungary on October 2 a nationwide referendum will be held on the question:  
  
*Do you want the European Union to be able to mandate the obligatory resettlement of non-Hungarian citizens into Hungary even without the approval of the National Assembly?*   
   
  The referendum is referred to as the quota referendum and was triggered by the European Union’s mandatory resettlement quotas it announced in response to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said it is ""no secret that the Hungarian government refuses migrant quotas"" and will be campaigning for ""no"" votes. Orbán argued the quota system would ""redraw Hungary's and Europe's ethnic, cultural and religious identity, which no EU organ has the right to do."" After many legal challanges were heard and dismissed by the Constitutional Court President János Áder was able to confirm the referendum 5 months after it was initially supposed to be held.   
   
  
  The Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) closely involved in the quota referendum campaign, mocking the government's anti-immigrant messages and phrases. The party spent €100,000 (the most of all the opposition parties) of voluntary donation from 4,000 people for their posters with satirical slogans, such as ""Did you know there's a war in Syria?"", ""Did you know one million Hungarians want to emigrate to Europe?"", ""Did you know? The perpetrators in most corruption cases are politicians"" and ""Did you know? During the Olympics, the biggest danger to Hungarian participants came from foreign competitors"". Party leader Gergely Kovács told BBC News that ""[...] What we can do is appeal to the millions in Hungary who are upset by the government campaign. We want them to know they are not alone"". Thus the party asked the people to vote invalidly.""  
  
  Opinion polling heavily favours the No side with the most recent polling indicating around 70% support.

**Fact of the Day – Early Elections in New Zealand**    
  
  Today’s fact of the day is brought to you by the Electoral Commission.  
  
New Zealand's first elections were like small-scale replicas of those in Britain. Once the returning officer had set a date for the nomination of candidates, a temporary wooden stage - known as the 'hustings' - would be erected in some prominent public place.  
  
Sometimes large, unruly crowds would gather on nomination day; on other occasions only a handful of electors would bother to show up. Candidates had to be proposed and seconded by registered electors, but the candidates themselves did not have to be present.  
  
If there were more candidates than seats to be filled, those electors present would vote by a show of hands. Defeated candidates or their supporters could then demand that a poll be taken, and this would normally be held a day or two later.  
  
Voting was held on working days, and polls were only open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Each elector had to hand the polling official a voting paper, containing the name of his chosen candidate(s) and his own details. These voting papers were usually supplied (and filled in) by the candidates' committees. There was little or no secrecy about the way people voted.  
  
Auckland's early elections were especially notorious for drunkenness and corruption.  
  
In 1855, one candidate's committee room was described as 'nothing better than a common drinking booth a regular tippling-shop', where 'half-intoxicated men were seen either reeling out of their own accord, or being dragged to record their votes at the poll'.  
   
Another was said to have 'rolled a hogshead of rum into the street with his own hands, and invited the electors to fall in'. So much free grog was distributed in the military Pensioner Settlements electorate that, according to one observer, 'one pensioner is already dead, and another dying' from overindulgence.  
  
There were also frequent allegations of 'treating' (where candidates provided free alcohol or food to entice electors to vote for them), bribery and intimidation of electors.  
  
In addition, some electoral rolls were inaccurate or bloated with out-of-date or false entries. This made it easy for unscrupulous electors to impersonate others and vote twice.  
  
Often, however, early parliamentary elections attracted little attention, especially in rural areas. Even the largest electorates usually only had one or two polling booths. Sometimes settlers needed to travel on horseback for a day to cast their votes. Not surprisingly, many didn't bother.    
  
  
The New Zealand Parliament - alarmed by reports of electoral abuses in Auckland - soon decided that the electoral laws needed tightening up.    
  
So in 1858 it passed a series of reform acts, which defined and prohibited treating, bribery and 'undue influence'. Candidates were banned from employing musicians and displaying banners. The placement of committee rooms and polling booths in pubs was also outlawed.  
   
At the time, some politicians urged the adoption of the secret ballot (often called the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' ballot, as it was first adopted in Victoria in 1856). They claimed that this would help stamp out bribery, treating and intimidation - because there would be less incentive to try to influence or threaten electors if their votes could not be traced.  
  
But not everyone thought that voting should be secret. To many, the vote was not an individual right but an important 'public trust' granted to certain citizens to exercise on behalf of their community. Open (public) voting ensured that the holders of this trust were accountable to those who were excluded from the franchise - including, for example, women.   
  
So, instead of the secret ballot, in 1858 Parliament introduced a new verbal voting system. Each elector was required to state the name of the candidate he wished to vote for out loud to the polling official. The official would then record the vote in a poll book, and the elector would sign his name alongside the entry.  
  
This method, its supporters claimed, would at least require the elector to be sober enough to speak. Of course verbal voting was not secret - in 1860 one Auckland newspaper even published a list showing how every elector had voted.  
  
Verbal voting lasted until 1870, when Parliament finally agreed to adopt the secret ballot.  
  
At the 1871 general election, each voter was given a printed ballot paper listing the candidates in their electorate. They marked the paper in private behind a screen and then deposited it into a locked ballot box. This established a method of voting that has been more or less the same ever since.
Secret voting was important because it reinforced the idea that the vote was an individual right, which each elector should be free to exercise according to their conscience, without fear of intimidation. This helped to open the way for the later expansion of the franchise to all adult men - and eventually to women.  
  
The secret ballot and other reforms also did much to improve election-day behaviour, and since the 1870s voting in New Zealand general electorates have usually been orderly and above suspicion of corruption.    
  
Although the secret ballot was introduced in European seats in 1870, it was not considered suitable for Māori elections. Māori continued to vote under the old verbal system - in which electors told the polling official who they wanted to vote for - until the 1938 election.  
  
There were also no electoral rolls for the Māori seats.  
  
Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Māori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Māori seats, rolls were not introduced until 1948-9.

  Near-unanimity means agreement has been given on behalf of the overwhelming majority of members of Parliament.  
  
(2)     The Speaker is the judge of whether unanimity is possible and, if it is not, whether a sufficient degree of near-unanimity has been reached for there to be an effective determination by the committee.  
  
(3)     Before determining that near-unanimity has been reached, the Speaker must be satisfied that, having regard to the party membership in the House, the proposed determination is fair to all parties and does not discriminate against or oppress a minority party or minority parties.

milk AND price,g55q4r,Global milk prices historically track with oil prices. How will the collapse in the oil price in America effect our dairy industry ?,newzealand,29,0.68,"The relationship between world milk price and oil price has been known for many years. This is not a loose link. It is tied to the cost of production in the USA and Europe ,which is highly dependent on oil price because the herds are managed in herd homes and fed harvested feeds which all have a significant oil price component in their cost structure. Compare NZ, in which herds are managed and largely fed in grass paddocks and are not sensitive to the change in oil price.

A low USA oil price means that the USA can produce milk more cheaply than can NZ and can out-compete NZ on the international market. With an overall reduction in demand for commodities there may be a vanishing demand for international dairy products, just as the world is now experiencing a vanishing demand for oil.

Tonight at midnight, Tuesday the 21 April 2020 Global Dairy Trade, hold their next international auction of dairy products. Tomorrow morning we will have some idea what the fallout will be. 

In most countries, dairy production is consumed locally including the USA. There are only a small number of players in the international market and NZ is a major supplier. But if costs lower in the USA producers can ramp up production in one season and produce a surplus which then has to be sold on the international market.  This happens because USA's domestic milk production is massive compared to NZ's total production.  A modest surplus can eclipse NZ's total production.. These factors could make NZ's milk production uneconomic and could destroy another major sector of NZ's overseas earnings. 

I am not an expert on any of this. I am simply aware that these factors exist. I welcome any discussion,  including correction, on this topic.",2020-04-21,

The price of groceries has increased significantly more than nzs inflations. The price of msot goods has doubled but inflation this year only rose by a few percent. 

The increase of prices also isn't uniform. Small scale shops selling vegatables or meat products are able to sell at around -40% of the super markets prices (slightly more than the start of the year consistent with inflation). 

The real issue is that the supermarkets duopoly has been shrunken towards a monopoly. Countdown knows there's a lack of competitions as they're all the same chain and pack and save the only competitor hasn't expanded as successful as them and has way less stores and can't possibly service all thier new unhappy customers. So prices just go up and up and up.

milk AND price,p0b87g,The price of cheese examined...,newzealand,22,0.57,"The price of a block of cheese is often held aloft as a symbol of the expensive cost of living. Let's take a look a bit closer...

So a block of Colby is about 56% milk solids (fat and protein). So from that we know that at a payout of $7.55/kgms, the cost of the raw milk required to produce a 1kg block of cheese is $4.22. 

Now I don't know much about the process of making the cheese, other than the sheer size and complexity of the 'cheddar-master' machines is impressive, having been through a tour of a fonterra factory. So let's say the processing cost is $3 per block. (Remember, raw milk is about 10% milk solids so, a 1kg block of cheese is actually equivalent to 5.5 litres of milk). Also remember, cheese is aged for a long time, not sure about Colby, but tasty cheese can be aged for a year or longer. So now the cost of the cheese is at $7.22. 

Now, Fonterra sell this to the supermarket. Let's say they  aim for a 30% GP (gross profit). So they would sell to the supermarket for $10.31 (the GP portion is $3.09). Remember, from their gp they have to pay the collection costs (the tankers and the drivers), distribution costs, they have to cover the maintenance at their factories, admin staff, tax etc

Now the supermarket will also need to add their markup, let's say 20%. This brings us to a retail price of $14.82 incl. GST for a 1kg block. The supermarket is making $2.58, from which they need to pay distribution costs to get it from their DC to individual stores, their staff to put it on the shelf and the checkout operator. They also need to factor in damaged stock, and old expired stock that needs to be thrown out, and cover the cost of running the store, the electricity for the fridge etc.

Now, I know that there is a lot of assumptions, but I hope that puts the price of cheese in perspective. I still find it expensive myself when I put a block in my trolley but it might be that the cost is not as unrealistic as we might think.

Edit: factored in GST.",2021-08-08,

milk AND price,12x7erk,"A way-too-long review of Supie: Good on quality, okay on price, poor on customer service.",newzealand,41,0.89,"If you just want to see pictures:

[$49 ""small family fruit and veggie bundle""](https://i.imgur.com/CCAGWo6.png)

[$25 ""No waste meat bundle""](https://i.imgur.com/VCC0B54.png)

**TLDR:** I am going to keep using supie, and happily so if this quality/price/reliability stays the same and I don\`t run into anything else where I need to talk to customer service. It will not replace the regular supermarket duopoly completely, nor the Asian market, but it’s definitely a nice thing and I’m glad it exists. The customer service though, really needs work.

**Context**: We’re a relatively frugal household whose regular grocery store is Pak and Save and various Asian markets. Meat-eaters but not carnivores, mostly cook at home with takeaways maybe twice a month, and some shortcuts (e.g. jarred sauce, canned beans, slow cooker / bread maker) when cooking. The big draws for trying supie were (not necessarily in this order):

\- avoiding the absolute madness of the supermarket (and especially supermarket parking lot) on weekends

\- wanting to support challengers to the duopoly

\- minimizing the analysis paralysis of trying to balance a shopping list with a budget when prices or expectations (e.g. unavailable produce) change unexpectedly

\- being forced to be a bit more creative in the kitchen rather than making the same 4 meals over and over again. (spaghetti bolognaise, Japanese curry, bangers and mash, sticky chicken/tofu).

**Grocery Availability: 6/10**

I wanna split this up between swaps/refunds after purchase, and general availability. They didn’t swap anything in my first order, everything I ordered was exactly the thing that arrived (except for the missing stuff, maybe they swapped it with air haha). There were a few swaps within the fruit/veggie bundle, but it was relatively sensible, like swapping onions for shallots and potato for kumera. So 9/10 there. In my second order, no swaps but one refund for unavailability (a lee kum kee instant sauce pack, so no biggie).

In terms of general availability, I think Supie gets a 4.5 or a 5. I understand they don’t have the means or the economy of scale to have “grocery store” staples like a bakery department or a deli, but it’s these really obvious staples that are missing when you go to order. Like as an example, the only ham is 250g for $8. For reference, that’s $34/kg, whereas most of the (multiple!) options at pak and save are between $19 and $25, with the absolute cheapest being $14/kg. If you want sliced turkey, chicken, roast beef, etc, there’s nothing either. They’re also missing a lot when it comes to dry goods. There’s no dried chickpeas/legumes (with the exception of premium Ceres Organics lentils) The largest pack of rice is 1kg, the largest pack of flour is 1.5kg. None of this is the end of the world, but it means Supie isn’t replacing a grocery store, so much as either supplementing it, or with the idea that you’ll go with Supie + butcher + baker, which kind of offsets the supposed savings.

A lot of Asian food and junk food I’m used to for work lunches and things were also missing (e.g. those MRE curries in a box, Samyang noodles, dried mushrooms), as well as some little stuff light lightbulbs or pencils, but these are kinda hit and miss everywhere. Stuff like fast-cook rice, sugar, cat food, you usually only have one option and the price isn\`t always great.

**Grocery Price: 7/10**

To sum it up, stuff is more expensive than the cheapest (ie Pam’s) option at the supermarket, but for the brans you’re buying it’s about the same price. I think the biggest benefit/savings comes from the “bundles” of produce and the “no waste” line of milk/bread/meat/etc. This stuff is good value for money if you’ll use it, and addresses food waste as well. Really, the savings from the bundles are really what sets the ""weekly shop"" price way ahead for my household.

**Grocery Quality: 10/10**

The veggies they sent were a good ripeness, the variety of the fruit/veggie bundle was great, seemed like value for money, and the other items they sent were also well packed and within date, nothing smushed or leaking. Really, no complaints here.

**Customer Service 2/10**

Oh man this is so long and I could probably complain for hours, but I’ll try to keep it short.

\- Website breaks first time I try to use it, I open a ticket

\- Get told to make another account, turns out some links accidentally send you to a test page

\- Make another account, make the first order, the free shipping from premium membership (supie +) isn’t applied. Get told on that initial ticket they’ll add a $15 credit to my account.

\- Make order #1. It arrives, no swaps/substitutions, everything’s good quality, but it’s missing the $25 meat pack. Open another ticket

\- It takes **a full week** for my ticket to get responded to. This is super annoying for reasons that aren’t really supie’s fault (I didn’t have any other protein so had to go to the supermarket anyways, annoying! But I was also was naïve and thinking maybe they would bring the missing items in the next day or so, and we have an absolutely tiny freezer so I didn’t want to go buy stuff and fill it up.)

\- They add a $25 credit to my account (the original $15 credit still isn’t there).

\- I wait a bit because I don’t want to throw good money after bad, but I cave and make a second order.

\- Second order comes, looks great, meat pack arrives as expected. Actually, I suspect they may have doubled it. I’m not sure whether I should open another ticket and ask if it was en error, respond to the first ticket, or not say anything and feel like a scammer for getting a refund AND extra meat.

I will say that everyone I’ve talked to has been nice, nobody’s been rude, but the week+ time delay is pretty ridiculous when their website says they respond in “a few hours”, or hit and miss resolutions (I’m still technically out $15 I think). I wish I knew if they also included extra meat on purpose, but I guess I’ll find out next time.

**Conclusion:** Read the TLDR lol. Sorry this was so long.

So much of the stuff on reddit I've seen lately is just totally positive about Supie, or just saying the price isn't that great, so I wanted to give my very middle-of-the-road experience.",2023-04-24,

I always thought it was due to export demand increasing local prices, but that doesn't makes sense either, as I have heard that one can find Mainland brand milk on the shelf in LONDON for less than it is here.  So shipping isn't the reason.

But then of course people would eat more fresh and low sugar foods and we might scoot down a bit on the ladder of obesity.

Christopher Luxon and all he’ll never do or know
The price of living with dignity.

Emily Writes

Christopher Luxon will never drag his mattress into the lounge of his home so that he and his wife and his newborn baby can sleep in the only warm place in his flat.

He will never lie his baby between them, using their bodies to keep their little one warm. Won’t get the dog under the covers in bed with the kids to warm them too.

Christopher Luxon will never use glad wrap on the windows to try to stop the rain leaking through, hold in the heat, and stop the mould, will never go without cooking to save power, will never drink hot water just to warm his body, will never wear a coat to bed, will never put socks on his child’s hands to protect them from the cold.

Christopher Luxon will never cough blood, after getting sicker and sicker in a damp and freezing place you could never call a home.

Christopher Luxon will never go to a job interview and hope his empty stomach doesn’t growl because he hasn’t eaten in 24 hours. And he won’t mentally struggle in that job interview because all he can think about is his gnawing belly.

Christopher Luxon won’t go to a group job interview and watch as a minimum-wage employer discounts him immediately due to his age, or race, or sexuality.

Chrisopher Luxon won’t go to a job and hope he doesn’t get injured or worse as he earns the least amount you can give someone for a job and get away with it.

Christopher Luxon won’t ever be a sexually harassed by his boss and have to try to avoid going near the chiller when he’s there because there’s no other jobs for a teenager in this town.

Christopher Luxon will never hold a tray of champagne flutes steady as men who look just like him smack his ass to see if he drops them. He will never swallow it because it’s a job and jobs are hard to come by.

Christopher Luxon won’t drive his car on empty, hoping he can just get to his job, because if he doesn’t it’s over and what then?

Christopher Luxon won’t water down the milk so he can get enough money for petrol, won’t have to leave home in the darkest morning to get to work on time by public transport that never comes on time.

Christopher Luxon won’t get stomach cramps from eating the bruised kiwifruit they can’t sell after his shift, won’t get sick from eating the pies that the dairy owner throws out at the end of the night, won’t have to go to the foodbank for dented tins of tomatoes and face the volunteer who is so sorry, so very sorry.

Christopher Luxon won’t go hungry so his children can eat. Won’t drink tea constantly to fill his shrinking tummy, won’t have to feed his babies flour and water. Won’t stand in the kitchen so nobody can see he isn’t eating.

Christopher Luxon won’t choose between school and a job, won’t fall asleep in class because he’s so hungry and tired, won’t look at his mum and wish he could make it all better for her.

Christopher Luxon won’t tell her he can quit school and get a job, any job.

Christopher Luxon won’t have to quit university, quit dreams, quit it all.

Christopher Luxon won’t drink to forget, smoke to escape, take drugs to feel something other than this brutal life that keeps shitting on him over and over again.

Christopher Luxon won’t borrow from next week, then the one after, and the one after that always chasing and chasing.

Christopher Luxon won’t know the vernacular of exclusion, won’t feel like he’s a child on the outside looking in.

Christopher Luxon won’t move houses five times before he’s five, won’t give up on making friends because the landlord is just going to up the rent and their little family will have to move again and again and again, and he’ll never know what it’s like not to feel like he stands on stable ground, like this country is his too, won’t ever know what it feels like to put a picture on the wall with a pin and say ‘this is my home’.

Christopher Luxon won’t live in his car.

Christopher Luxon won’t live in a garage.

Christopher Luxon won’t live with his whole family in one room, knowing nothing is theirs, will ever be theirs.

Christopher Luxon won’t wake up and think I can’t live like this anymore and wonder what it’s like to go to sleep and not wake up and never be hungry again and never have to fight so hard for enough to pay the rent, he will never know that sometimes it’s just

one

more

thing

and that thing is just too much and you can’t fight anymore.

*

Christopher Luxon doesn’t know these things. Won’t ever know these things. But he is materially rich. And on that mountain of money that keeps growing and growing he can say this:

Your free ride is over under National.

This is an AMAZING piece Emily. &lt;3 And not only that - Christopher Luxon won't even experience the things regular, middle class kinds of people do - nothing serious but the kinds of things that happen when you don't own seven houses. So completely out of touch with the most vulnerable and even those of us that are privileged enough to afford health insurance but not holidays, or groceries but not restaurant dinners out once a week. He's really only understanding the top 1%

milk AND price,127pki7,"Just some opinions from an ""outsider"" about the recent experience",newzealand,70,0.82,"New Zealand has basically left me with some of the best and warmest memories in my life. From my own experiences here in 2019, both the natural environment and social environment here are literally amazing！It's so harmonious, open, cozy, friendly, progressive, and tolerant! For me it's just like the Jews from Egypt finally found their land of milk and honey across the Red Sea. Everything just seems to work. 

Now I address that New Zealand is not some real utopia with the""land of milk and honey"". It has its own issues like the housing price, the inflation or even potential recession, the ""not so sufficient"" economy, the recent political chaos, or the gang issues etc. I am also willing to understand the current kiwis' dilemma and your desire for something better than the current. Yet you guys still maintain a relatively rational  and friendly atmosphere, unlike some other countries which are plagued by the polarising politics and more and more frequent dogwhistle arguments. One thing is sure that you guys do love complaints, but rational and constructive complaints which could turn into the eagerness and motivation for change and reform. 

Overall, my experience in New Zealand was one of the most memorable and positive of my life. I was struck by the natural beauty and the warm, welcoming people. While there are certainly challenges and troubling dilemma, it's clear that Kiwis are potentially eagar to change. 

Hoping for more discussions！",2023-03-31,

&gt; Hi Inertiacreeping,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your feedback. We are sorry to hear of your experience with one of our products.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Processes and regular quality checks are in place during production, to ensure the quality of our cheese and its packaging. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Every batch of cheese used at Dairyworks is tested for texture and sensory evaluation. The development of flavour and texture depends on moisture, fat, salt and maturing conditions of the cheese. There can be variation in taste and texture within a batch and across batches of cheese.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We apologise for the inconvenience and disappointment this has caused you and enclose a voucher to compensate you for having had this experience with one of our products.
&gt; 
&gt;

They introduced a delivery service fee after ComCom bugged them, but it’s still disgusting how they’re masking the total delivery cost. ComCom are absolutely useless. And it was Consumer NZ that alerted ComCom in the 1st place.

I contacted John Hart and he assured me it was a smear campaign, and I said I'd try and verify (or not ) the claims when I got time. John helpfully pointed out who was behind the email.

**Who's behind it?**  
The Opinion Partnership. John Third (Wellington businessman), Owen Jennings (former Federated Farmers president and ACT caucus member) and John Ansell (of Iwi/Kiwi fame).

**The Claims**

The talking points are terribly framed as multi choice questions, but I'll try to get to the guts of each claim.

**1. Of all major rivers in the developed world that flow through farmland, the OECD found Clutha rated 1st, the Waitaki 2nd and the Waikato 4th for cleanliness**  
True. I couldn't find the survey but Gareth Morgan of all people [wrote a nice piece using the data.](http://garethsworld.com/blog/environment/new-zealands-water-context/) He also points out the OECD data is 10 years old.  
&gt;The OECD data is interesting in that it shows the three New Zealand rivers covered (Waikato, Waitaki and Clutha) have very low levels of nitrates and relatively low levels of total phosphorous compared to major rivers in other developed countries.

&gt;Indeed the Waitaki and Clutha rivers have the lowest and second lowest nitrate levels of any of the 98 rivers reported on. The Waikato has the fourth lowest level of nitrates. Furthermore the differences between our rivers with levels of around 0.02mgN/litre and those with some of the highest nitrate levels, such as France’s Seine at 5.6, and England’s Thames at 6.6mgN/litre, is enormous.

**2. Our three longest rivers were found to have very low levels of nitrates, and relatively low levels of total phosphorus**  
This is just a different way of framing Question 1 and is indeed true (see above)

**3. The latest Commission for the Environment report said 90% of New Zealand rivers are getting cleaner, Russel Norman lied and said water quality was getting worse**  
This one is tough and the science isn't simple, and notice the authors were talking about rivers and then accused Norman of lying about water? Using the measures of nitrate and phosphate, rivers *are* getting cleaner but that phosphate has to end up somewhere, and that's in the sediment of slow moving rivers and in lakes.

**4. Only 17 of our 1000 rivers are still rated very poor for cleanliness. But the Commissioner for the Environment reports that each one is getting cleaner**  
Couldn't find anything to back that up, but this quote from the report suggests it may be a porky . . .  
&gt; The nitrogen stress is rising year on year in nearly all regions of the country,
especially in Canterbury, Southland and Otago. While regions like Manawatū and
Waikato are predicted to have a lesser increase in nitrogen load, many rivers and lakes in these regions already have high nutrient loads and poor water quality.  
The phosphorus stress is relatively constant, but keeps accumulating in the sediment in most water bodies, particularly lakes.

**5. We use only 1.2% of our available fresh water. That’s nearly the lowest in the OECD. South Korea uses 43%**  
True, e consume just 1.2% of our total renewable water resources each year. It's high per capita (950 cubic metres) but low as an overall amount.

These reports got me thinking.

**Oravida connection and the environment**

The destructive company turns out to be directed by Judith Collins' husband and the usual Oravida crowd:

&gt;The 22-hectare site in Mikonui Valley, 31 km south of Hokitika, was mined for gold by NZG Limited. The company's four listed directors include: James Blackwell, Julia Jiyan Xu, Stone Shi, and David Wong-Tung. The first three of these directors are also directors of Oravida Limited. Wong-Tung, who is married to National MP Judith Collins, is a former director of Oravida Limited.


The delinquent mining company is part of a bigger web of companies all directed and owned by the same Oravida crew.  Eg, [NZG Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/1814679/directors) is owned by [NZG 2010 Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3112805/directors) which has the same directors. In turn, NZG 2010 Ltd is owned by [Kauri NZ Investment Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2368431/directors) which is owned by [Kauri NZ Trustee Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/2368430/directors) which is owned by [JW Blackwell Holdings Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/7045549/shareholdings). All the directors are some variation of the above. Amazingly, DOC signed off on them leaving the landscape in this state.

Another of the associated companies is [Kauri Ruakaka Ltd](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/7045549/shareholdings), the company which caused a national fuel crisis by [indiscriminately digging up the ground in Northland](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/398917/fuel-pipeline-rupture-inquiry-tells-companies-to-invest-in-infrastructure) looking for swamp kauri to export to China. Swamp kauri is [found in mud]( https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/swamp-kauri/). 

Through an [allegedly torturous process](https://fmacskasy.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/doing-the-business-with-john-key-heres-how-part-rua/) many of the Oravida directors are also associated with the Shanghai Pengxin buy-out of [Crafar farms](https://www.interest.co.nz/news/41351/exclusive-nzs-biggest-dairy-farmer-allows-calves-starve-death-update-6) (now [Theland](https://farmersweekly.co.nz/section/dairy/view/more-fresh-milk-flying-to-china)), which is one of the biggest dairy farm groups in NZ. And of course Judith Collins herself was neck deep in the [Oravida dairy milk scandal](https://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/timeline-judith-collins-and-oravida-2014050512). In winter, cows often [produce mud]( https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/114607024/cows-in-mud-new-images-stir-up-cropping-concerns-once-more).
Is anyone else noticing a pattern here? 

I don't mean the corruption, that’s not news. I mean the mud.

**The Wilberforces**

To understand the mud connection we have to go back to the late 1970s. One of New Zealand's most respected writers is [Maurice Gee](https://www.read-nz.org/writer/gee-maurice/). He mainly writes realistic novels full of observation on NZ. In 1979 he wrote *[Under the Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain)*, and I think he was trying to warn us of what was to come.

This story features the Wilberforces, 

&gt;a family of slimy, slug-like beasts who could take on human form. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain_\(miniseries\)).

They pretend to be a normal human husband, wife, etc but this is just shape-changing. Their true form is very different. Here is [a 1981 dramatization of one of them changing](https://teara.govt.nz/en/video/45704/under-the-mountain).

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Mountain_\(film\)#Characters), their modus operandi as as follows:

&gt;A race of symbiotic organisms consisting of a slug-like brain (roughly twice the mass of an adult human) and a large worm like body the size of an aircraft carrier. According to the account given to the twins by Mr. Jones, the Wilberforces originated millions of years ago on a world consisting of **seas of mud** which nourished the worm organisms. 

&gt;Threatened with extinction, the Wilberforces resolved themselves to conquering other worlds, **using their technology to reform other planets' surfaces into mud** in order to thrive and breed. When they had finished using a planet's resources, no life remained on that world.

**Conclusion**

It seems pretty obvious that Judith Collins and David Wong-Tung are actually not human. They are Wilberforces, as are their cronies. That would explain what they are doing leaving an enormous mud hole in Conservation land, and it would explain their appetite for destroying our country.


Circumstantial evidence supports this too. Wilberforces create a network of [portals through the mud](https://youtu.be/GIiDQauIapo?t=33). Last year, Judith Collins and David Wong Tung suddenly decided to sue some random people for a [2011 landslide]( https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/113575823/nationals-judith-collins-sues-nelson-council-residents-over-2011-slip) which involved a lot of mud coming down near one of their rentals. The people they were suing expressed confusion, but this lawsuit could well be an attempt to cover up the fact that it was caused by a portal Collins and Wong Tung had tunnelled through the mud, for faster travel when they are in their non-human forms. Also, in *Under the Mountain*, Wilberforce headquarters are in Takapuna, which is just two letters away from Papakura, Judith Collins’ electorate!

The more I think about it, the more it all makes sense.

But I think the time has come to make them pay. Irrigation in marginal farming areas is wrecking our rivers. They are drawing off so much water to feed their profit margins that it is altering the ecology of the whole river system. I'm hoping that a water tax will make them think twice about their water use.

Having worked on dairy farms in Canterbury, I've seen how much water these farmers draw off, and its a staggering amount, and simply not sustainable. And they always want more.

If you are a farmer who is harping on that this tax might drive you off the land, then you shouldn't be farming in marginal land. Especially in Canterbury: the conditions here are totally unsuited to dairy farming (more suited to sheep and beef), and farmers are abusing the environment just to line their pockets.

And then there are the National types who declare that farming is the backbone of our economy and must continue. What they don't seem to realise is that if farmers keep fucking the environment for short-term financial gain, there will be nothing left to farm in say 100 years.",2017-09-12,

We burn things we don't have to, things we shouldn't, and things which would be better re-used in some other way.

Here's how it works:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) You're not meant to burn anything other than wood. It's strictly illegal with a small caveat of silage plastic in some areas. Don't do it. Take it to the dump or the metal recyclers.

(b) If you're a farmer, and you have a tree in a paddock taking up \~5 square meters of usable grass - consider keeping it. Otherwise animals tend to die during droughts.

(c) If you've chopped down a tree or scrub, consider donating the larger bits to your local firewood supplier - they need that stuff. Also the smaller bits, consider woodchipping and spreading the material, as NZ soils are notoriously low in carbon and this affects our meat and dairy. When you put it in the air, it doesn't help you out at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I've presented some reasonable alternatives here to being a stone-age person.

I have already read up on some information for NZ and have already notice some negatives and positives against Sweden/EU.
Sweden and NZ also have some agreements. First off both countries support a dual citizenship, which is a most for me. So here is some questions:

I do not have any real connection to NZ so the only way for me to get a citizenship is to work and live in NZ for 5+ years?

Is there any downside/responsibility for me becoming a citizen of NZ? (example being conscription or compulsory voting (like Australia))

Is the weather really that great? have looked at wellington as a possible new home, and it says that the record highest and lowest temp are +31.1 C and -1.9 C. Where I live the record highest temp is 36-37 C and record lowest is -32 C. So a normal year in Wellington is around 2-28 C over the year? If so that is amazing!

Is the housing pricing really THAT bad? 400 000 NZ dollar for a decent house. For that amount you can get a really nice house in Sweden. 

How is the renting for apartments? is it also high in cities?

How much for buying a apartment in wellington or Auckland?

How are other products? I know that video games can cost some extra. Are there any other products that are expansive? example meat, dairy products and furniture.

How easy is it to find a job in NZ? Preferably in IT (have some education + experience in that field. ""lower"" jobs in IT is fine totally fine! (call centers, IT support anything with IT really)) 

How good is the pay? saw that NZ ""only"" have 36k in GDP (PPP) while Sweden have 47k in GDP (PPP) (PPP stands for Purchasing power parity aka bang for the buck).

How is the relationship between AUS and NZ? are you free to live and work in both countries without a visa if you are either a aussie or a kiwi?

How is the education? all free including university? is the quality good?

How is the healthcare? free/quality?

Best websites for housing/renting? 

Best websites for jobhunting?

best websites for connecting with people in NZ? (as I will move to NZ as a single and only have 1 distant friend in NZ)

How is the current political situation in NZ? just link a good website if there is to much information.

How is the wild life? I saw that you only had like 3(?) dangerous spiders. Are there any sharks? Any other animal to look out for?

Any other information that you have is appreciated! Hopefully I can get some kind people to answer at least some of my questions!

If there are some questions about me or about Sweden/EU I am happy to answer them as well!

dairy AND quality,zvbrmt,Are Roses Chocolates really worse? A review of my first box in 20 years.,newzealand,28,0.78,"So after reading the thread about Roses chocolate on xmas morning while waiting for everyone to wake up, I opened my first present to find: a very squashed box of roses! So, here's my review on my first box of of Roses in nearly twenty years:

First thing I notice is that the twisted wrappers are gone, replaced by mini chocolate bar wrapping at each end. That's fine, keeps them sealed well. It does make it feel a little less special though, more like you're opening a mini Moro from a family pack at half time in your under 12s rugby game. 

PEPPERMINT CRUNCH: first up is of course, the peppermint. This brings me to something I don't like about the sealed wrappers: THE BOX DOESN'T SMELL LIKE PEPPERMINT WHEN YOU OPEN IT! That smell used to be like blood in the water for sharks. It would be the signal that the box was open and you had to be quick before your brother got the peppermint one. The chocolate itself is nothing like the old one. The gooey peppermint is replaced by a semi solid filling that is weirdly crunchy. 6/10 and a very disappointing start. 

WHITE RASPBERRY:  Well the nice strawberry one is gone and it seems like it has been replaced by raspberry. This one actually isn't too bad. Fairly average quality white chocolate filled with flecks of freeze dried raspberry. 7/10

TURKISH DELIGHT: This one (which is one of my favourites but mostly unpopular) seems to have gone through the least change. It is still the strangely gooey version and the only change I can see is that there's less filling than there's was before, so still worse than the old ones:7/10 (but most of you hate it anyway)

VANILLA NOUGAT: one of the new flavours, and the first truly awful chocolate. This thing is terrible! It looks and tastes like cream textured wallpaper from the 80s and reminded me of when I ate a chocolate eclair that was left out in the sun too long and made me sick. 1/10.

HAZELNUT CRISP: This one remains pretty similar to the old one, I remember not liking it as a kid but amongst the abominations found here, it stand up pretty well. 7/10.
DARK MOCHA NOUGAT: The same awful nougat as the vanilla version, but it's flavoured with the leftover milky coffee from one of those machines at a 24 hour dairy. Kids will hate it and adults will too. 3/10.

HAZELNUT SWIRL: I'm not sure why you need two different hazelnut flavours in one small box, but this is my least favourite of the two. Even so, it is just your generic praline so one of the better ones. Also, WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE HALF A WALNUT?! 6/10.

CLASSIC CARAMEL: This is the only one that tastes exactly like I remember. I hated it then, and I still don't like it. Some people might, but it's just not for me. The only change seems to be  thinner chocolate than before, so it loses a point for that. 4/10.

CARAMEL DELUXE: This one had me worried because if Cadbury could screw up their own peppermint chocolate, I don't trust them with Caramello. Luckily this also seems to be largely the same, if a little smaller and with less filling than before. 8/10. 

And that's all folks! In conclusion, yes, Roses are worse than they were before, but not complete garbage. It's a shame really. I guess I'll just have to wait for Easter for my beloved Creme Egg, because I know Cadbury would never mess with such a treasured seasonal treat.",2022-12-26,
dairy AND quality,49mv50,Cannabis &amp; New Zealand's Future,newzealand,17,0.55,"Hello /r/newzealand 

First off I ask not to dismiss this as another attempt at getting cannabis legal. 

Recently New Zealand dairy farmers have been going through tough times and falling milk prices are having huge effects on the sustainability of this industry &amp; it seems like the golden era of New Zealand dairy farming is ending. Farmers are losing livelihoods, employers can no longer employ people, new farmers are finding basically impossible to get jobs in the industry (correct me if I'm wrong). 

All these farmers have huge expanses of land that are going unused or being sold to survive, as well as being sold to international investors who have money to buy up this land from New Zealanders who can no longer sustain it. So I was just thinking since we have so many New Zealanders losing jobs and livelihoods, why don't they take advantage of the land, the resources they have and start producing either Recreational, Medical or Industrail Cannabis/Hemp as a complete new industry to get into or to substain until dairy prices return to something that can sustain them. 

I just see the future  New Zealand kicking it self 5-10 years down the track because we have this real negative view on cannabis use, supply, production. The Cannabis industry in New Zealand could be one of the greatest and compare to Colorado in size. 

So please tell what's good &amp; what's bad when it comes to helping farmers through this tough time by making a regulated industry from cannabis. 

As well as helping farmers it means police can focus on other crime, P which is destroying people &amp; communitys (I know people personally that turn to P when cannabis is not available, it's just as sad as it sounds), creating a new ""Golden Age"" industry, just as profitable as dairy if not more. 

We are going to be kicking ourselves over all this in a few years, when it's a normal thing to have legal Cannabis. I just hope this fosters a discussion that I believe is crucial to New Zealand's future. Feel free to prove me wrong or right.

dairy AND quality,yz3w5d,It's time we talk budgetting!,newzealand,41,0.85,"Hi r/newzealand, I'm back with my unwanted wisdom!

**A background to me**; I'm a 20 y/o working at a Supermarket (now in management, I passed my chef course, but passed on the career path.) I (and my partner) spend aprox. $40-80 a week for food, all meals included. (This varies, you'll see why soon). 

I very often see people complaining about food prices, and I absolutely get it. I'm making this post after receiving a Countdown flyer in the mail, and I find their 'sale' prices horrid. Now I don't have kids obviously, however I cook 6 nights a week. I was for awhile cooking for 3/4 people (flat mates) and can absolutely stretch a budget. 

**So what was so bad about the Advertised sale prices?** Simple. The advertised sale prices are not the best they can or will do. If you're being attracted to a store by a sale you've seen on TV or in a flyer odds are it is bad. Some are good, most are not. 

**So what should we be looking for while shopping?**

Short-dated items - Countdown does this the best from what I have seen. In each department they will have sections where they put their expiring stock, they often do really, really good deals on cheap food. Buy this and build your meals around it. Look for things you can add rice/pasta (or other carbs) to. Cheap meat, veges. 

Cheap meal bases - A meal base as I deem it is an item, or group of items, you can take and make multiple different meals with when you buy additional (cheap) ingredients. For example chicken, you can turn chicken breast into a curry, a stew, oven baked, grilled on salads (curry is your king of value and time, nothing comes close, like how Nachos/Chilli con Carne used to be cheap.) Other examples invlude frozen vegetables (add a creamy sauce, chuck on rice.) Pasta (buy a cheap sauce, add frozen veg.) Tinned tomatoes (add soy sauce, add frozen veg, chuck on... rice... add cheese, minding the wallet.) Just make sure you get enough protein!

Cheap meal additives - Tinned beans are my king here, they are energy dense, relatively cheap and healthy. Chuck these into random things, pasta (surprisingly) works, add with a tin of tomatos for a quick meal (make sure to add carbs, i.e rice, money maker!)

**What food(s) is(are) worth buying?**

Carbs - Your absolute king and money saver. Nothing comes remotely close to the price value. Filling and only somewhat unhealthy, make sure you're maxing out on your daily in take of carbs to keep your meals cheap. 

Cheap meat - Date shorted, chicken and pork are all good options. Look for roasts, sometimes these are surprisingly cheap and can last a week if you ration wisely, or can be added to new meals to stretch further.

In season Vegetables - I cannot stress enough, buy in season! My favourite example is tomatoes. In my store they topped out at $18.99 this year and their quality was... not appealing. Recently they have come down to $3.99 (4) a kg and look really good (buying some tomorrow). Finally within reason. Root vegetables like potato, carrots and kumura are usually reliable for pricing, onions are too. Base your meals on what's in season. You wouldn't buy lots of imported berries, right?

**Why does my budget not stretch as far as it used to?**

It isn't just inflation. What is cheap to buy has changed. Best example is beef. What I grew up cooking with my parents is a rare luxury (chili con carne... I miss you). Meat in general has increased in price, dairy too. Other examples include tinned tomatoes (they aren't expensive, but they were comparatively cheaper.) Bacon and other deli cuts (avoid deli-meats, they're a rip off, $24.99 a k/g for h am? buy a roast and make it last 3 months and save yourself $6 a kg, ridiculous! This applies at cheaper prices too, seen roast ham as low as $8 in the past 12 months)

**Where should I shop?**

What is cheapest to you. Usually this is going to be Pak n Save, but if you're a young adult living on your own Count Down can be cheaper if you buy lots of short dated items. Bakery items can be cheaper there too, not always. Look around and regularly re-evaluate and compare.

**The Food Isn't As Nice**

Finding what works for you isn't going to be a day 1 win. Keep changing and experimenting. The culinary world constantly shifts to what is cheapest, you don't see people pot-roasting like my grandmothers both used to in the 60's and 70's. Food is driven by price and convenience. Look at what restaurants offer around you, that can give you a good indication as to what is cheap and in season. 

**This Sounds Exhausting**

I agree. It can sound intimidating, however I personally have grown to enjoy the challenge of finding the cheapest food items and creating meals out of them, not following recipes. Not following recipes is how I stumbled across how amazing cheap curry is, both in price and flavour.

&amp;#x200B;

I am all ears for constructive criticism. I will be putting out a few new recipes, but they take me a long time to get to a point I'm comfortable sharing them and risking people try something and it not be good. I want to make sure I'm not wasting people's time and especially money. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is of help to people, I really do. I've given similar advice to my parents who have made great use of it (cutting their shopping bill by about 40% when they choose to.)",2022-11-19,

dairy AND quality,r0yc9q,"I tried all the keto breads commonly found in NZ supermarkets (Vogel's, High Street, Dovetale)",newzealand,90,0.94,"I recently started on a ketogenic(ish) diet. Fooling your brain that mashed cauliflower is the same thing as potato is one thing—but the thing I was most worried about was bread. I fucking love bread, and every gluten-free bread I've tried before has been disappointments, so I will happily admit that I had a lot of preconceived notions about ""alt"" breads in general.

I couldn't dig up much info on the three brands I could find in Hamilton, other than a rather brief article on The Spinoff about gluten-free breads in general... So I did what any sane person would do and buy one of each, to see which one I like the best. I hope this is helpful to all three of you reading.

Per gram, Vogel's were the cheapest (this was a surprise to me) at 1.50¢/g, while Dovedale worked out to around 1.67¢/g, and Home St 2.33¢/g. In terms of carbs, Vogel's and Dovedale both clock in at around 1.2g per slice, while Home St clocks in at well under half a gram of carbs. These are all acceptable values for a meal of one or two slices, but most people probably shouldn't exceed that in one day for the first two brands. All are gluten and dairy free, and Home St and Dovedale are soy free; however, Dovedale is the only one that doesn't contain eggs (and therefore is vegan.)

Also to note is that Vogel's comes in a resealable pack, while the other two need to be moved to a ziplock bag.

I tried all three in four different ways to see which I liked the best: 

1. As is at room temperature fresh out of the package, 
2. Dry toasted on both sides (as you would get out of a toaster),
3. Buttered then toasted on one side in a pan, and
4. Toasted on one side in extra-virgin olive oil, with avocado, cracked pepper, and sea salt.

[Dovedale, High St, Vogel's \(L-R\)](https://preview.redd.it/acxsmp5g8h181.jpg?width=3468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1826b61e338efedebe231026a0691845928d2c21)

Okay, so let's start with Dovedale:

* On its own, the first thing it hits you with is the earthy taste of psyllium husk and linseed, coupled with a robust tartness that's not unlike a sourdough bread. Unfortunately, I found the grainy and fibrous texture to be a bit off-putting, and while it had a nice chew, it didn't have the softness that I was looking for, and I found it left a little bit of a gooey film in the mouth, like you might get with some animal fats.
* Toasting helps to mask the husk and roughage somewhat, and the texture improved a lot with a softer and more glutinous and moist crumb. Unfortunately, the sourness also got turned up a lot... I *like* sourdough, but I thought that was about as much as I would take without any spread or toppings. It also took longer to crisp up than the other breads, and I would say the crispiness was average with a slightly mealy outside.
* Buttered and pan-toasted, same as before, and that little bit of fat helps to make the bread even more rehydrated. It also toasted much more nicely with butter to help it along, and added a good amount of crunch on the outside too. Sadly as far as the flavour profile goes, I would describe the combination of the elevated tang and the butter as ""rancid"".
* As avocado toast is where this bread really shines. It hits all the right notes, complimenting the grassiness of the oil, while yielding to the avocado. If I do this again, I'll probably put extra black pepper.

Next up is High Street:

* It's noticeably sweeter and more complex, with a strong malty aroma that reminds me of chestnut, coupled with subtle sourness that has a surprising amount of depth. It's spongier than the other two breads, and middle of the road in terms of moistness. The texture is still a little grainy, but far less than Dovedale's, and much more pleasant to eat on its own. The crust strongly reminded me of when you burn eggs while making an omelette and you get that very dry, papery edges, which I really didn't like.
* With a bit of browning and heating, the texture doesn't improve, and in fact the outside surface dries out in a hard and brittle way that wasn't all that pleasant. There is a stronger eggier smell, (for better or worse,) and a slightly albuminous coating in the mouth (definitely for worse.)
* The butter helps to draw out the sourness, and like with Dovedale, it also toasts better with that bit of fat in the pan. The surface is cragglier and crispier without fighting you at every bite, and it was very absorbent of every drop of butter. Still got that weird mouthfeel afterwards, though.
* All the best qualities about this bread also makes it a pretty average avo toast. It masks all the good parts of an avocado and the olive oil, and just feels like too many different instruments playing at the same time.

And finally, the Vogel's:

* If the last two were going for an artisan sourdough-style bread, then the Vogel's is going for something that's closer to a brioche-style. It's buttery, slightly sweet, and the whole thing is complemented by walnut pieces that cut through nicely, and lingers to a chocolatey finish. The crumb is finer-grained but tougher than High St, and overall the bread is shorter and less springy.
* Toasting turns down the sweetness and turns up the nuttiness. The texture gets even shorter on the outside, almost in between bread and biscuit, and is a bit too dusty and crumbly for my taste, but it's not bad overall. The toasting was really even and consistent though, something that will remain consistent for the other two methods.
* Butter brings out more of a herbal character. The texture is not as crumbly as dry toast, and in fact it seems a bit more pliable and stretchy than untoasted. This is how I often eat bread, and the Vogel's one was probably my favourite out of the three.
* This really isn't the kind of bread you make avocado toast with.
* Just a note about Vogel's, though: who is this product for? Everything about its taste tells me it's a peanut-butter-and-jam bread, not a cheese-and-onion bread. A long-term goal for a lot of people on keto or low-carb will be to retrain their palate to stop sugar cravings. If you're marketing to people who simply want to be carb-conscious, great. If your major selling point is ""keto"", where your target audience will be all about the umami and the salty, not sure what that game plan is.

Overall:

* None of these breads will come close to Nature's Fresh/Tip Top bread for making boring old egg sandwiches.
* Vogel's is the least offensive out of the lot, and probably the bread my wife will tolerate the most.
* High St is a good product with really low carbs, but I'm not sure if I can justify the price.
* I've been eating a lot of avo toast lately, so the Dovedale is staying in the fridge for now.
* Which brand will I buy when I next go shopping for bread? Not sure, honestly. For me, keto isn't a permanent thing, and if these are the ""imitations"" offered to tie me over until I reach my goal weight, I think I'll be okay going without any of these.
* On the other hand, if I had to choose one of these as my only bread for the rest of my life, I'd pick High Street. It's a compromise choice that strikes a balance between everyday bread and trying to be a bit fancy.",2021-11-24,
dairy AND quality,u1o2v8,I WANNA BE DOUBLE HAPPY.,newzealand,41,0.66,"I recently moved back down south from the North island after spending the summer there. The quality of Milk Bar food has dropped significantly and being a tradie I just loved it up there. Fried chicken, pies, good coffee everywhere, sausage rolls, anything battered I wanna just hook into my veins. 

Alas, there is one tasty treat that stood out from the rest, 
The legendary DOUBLE HAPPY. 

I never realised until I had it that no matter how good a sausage roll is, it is always missing mashed potato.

Currently I'm only single happy.

dairy AND quality,118h556,The Therapeutic Products Bill: Separating the Myths from the Facts,newzealand,126,0.85,"Therapeutic Products Bill aims to regulate therapeutic products in New Zealand, including medicines, medical devices, natural health products, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, to ensure their safety, quality, and efficacy. The Bill will replace the current Medicines Act 1981, Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985, and other minor acts like the Sunscreen Act 2022. The purpose of the Bill is to protect and improve the health of all New Zealanders by regulating therapeutic products across their lifecycle. The Bill will require therapeutic products to receive market authorisation before being imported, exported, or supplied in New Zealand. The Bill also regulates controlled activities related to therapeutic products, including manufacturing, supply, exporting, clinical trials, and advertising restrictions. A Therapeutic Products Regulator will be established to oversee these regulatory matters.

Overall this looks to me like a good bill that fixes many flaws in the current Medicines Act. The bill has been through its first reading and is now accepting submissions until the 5th of March (11 days left). I wanted to read through some of the already-made submissions to get some good ideas of where there are potential issues with the legislation, but what I saw wasn’t what I was expecting!

Currently, there are 9500 submissions, and I’ve read the first 13 pages of them - 260 submissions in all. About 2-3% of the submissions are positive towards the bill, but most are less than a paragraph, with many people complaining about their “freedoms”. One submission was simply the words “No to the bill”.

You can read all the submissions on the Parliament website at:

There is a huge amount of misinformation and scaremongering, and I trust that the Select Committee can filter most of it out. One common misconception I noticed was people arguing that supplements (natural or otherwise) are proactive, preventative, fight sickness/disease, and/or always safe; therefore, they should have no regulation. Of course, this isn’t true, but maybe MPs will believe it if enough people repeat it. Looking at the science, most reviews investigating the use of supplements to reduce the risk of chronic diseases have shown little to no benefit, and some studies have also suggested possible risks associated with certain supplements. Here’s what I found:

[Effects of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions on Cardiovascular Outcomes](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-0341) (2019):

*“Use of omega-3 LC-PUFA and folate supplementation could reduce risk for some cardiovascular outcomes in adults. Combined calcium plus vitamin D might increase risk for stroke.”*

[Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for CVD Prevention and Treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718345601?via%3Dihub) (2018):

*“Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks.”*

[Vitamin and Mineral Supplements for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793447) (2022):

*“Vitamin and mineral supplementation was associated with little or no benefit in preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and death, with the exception of a small benefit for cancer incidence with multivitamin use. Beta carotene was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer and other harmful outcomes in persons at high risk of lung cancer.”*

[ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NUTRACEUTICALS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380172/) (2017):

*""However, they are not necessarily safe for everybody. Like regular drugs, supplements with active ingredients that provide a physiological or pharmacological effect are likely to also cause adverse effects in susceptible individuals. More attention to adverse effects and potential interactions is needed in order to avoid serious medical outcomes.""*

For the most part, multivitamins just create 'very expensive yellow urine' at best or, at worst, cause some harm. The media has reported that the supplements industry in NZ is worth over $2 billion. That’s a lot of money for products that do very little for the general population. So when I read people’s submissions saying they have been using supplements for their health for decades, it sadly shows they have been scammed for a long time. Here’s just one example: *“I have used health supplements almost daily such as vitamin C, D as well as zinc and ashwaganda for over two decades now.”* This isn’t evidence of the need for less regulation, as they suggest, but quite the opposite.

Filtering out the obviously crap submissions and duplicates, I have created a list of claims from submissions that could do with debunking.

*“What this suggests is that pharmacists are able to sell ingredients for highly addictive drugs and shop assistants can reccomend highly damaging drugs and ingredients that havent met saftey standards.”*

I **urge everyone to make a submission** \- help balance out the misinformation, show support for the Bill and debunk some codswallop (there’s plenty there for everyone!).",2023-02-21,
dairy AND quality,b4ykcb,Green fairy,newzealand,21,0.38,"Hello 

With the past few weeks of the pain that we have all experienced I have decided to do what I feel is right and not what the  current laws point of view is.

I am looking for advice or experiences others have in this area.

My father  (58yrs) passed away from bowel cancer and recently l have also lost 2 cousins (brothers 27 &amp; 35 to different cancers), I have also struggled with mental health issues (Bi polar type)  for the last 25 yrs,  

Dad went from a strong individual to bed ridden in a short time. His only relief legally available was strong doses of morphine that was really  when he died and just the body holding on. I believe I would have had more time if he responded to Cannabis as others have, but condemned by the powers who be.

I have been through many strong pharmaceutical prescription medications and I have recently found one that is helping but believe at a 60% rate.

What I have experienced with these medications is that they are designed to alter brain chemistry and while they definitely altered me , unfortunately it wasn’t whatever isn’t right in me.
I think I have suffered more from these chemicals than what they were trying to fix.  

I was able to use Cannabis early on (20yrs old) and it was a great benefit to me, but I had a new family and wanted to be able support them as best I could.
This led me to become career focused and take on greater responsibilities through work (dairy farming) and was able to achieve award winning managing achievements.

However while I continued to take the prescribed medications -which I allowed to have a good length of time (8-12mths) to work, I was also subjected to random drug testing with different employments.  

With the meds not helping and changing of my brain in a negative way I turned to alcohol for relief. Not a couple of drinks but a box of wine a day usually in 2hr time period. This allowed me to pass out and not have the roller coaster ride, unfortunately alcohols side effect is it makes you drunk, (went from sober to passing out very fast, no middle time).

This was still the best way of legally controlling my symptoms and allowing me to get functional by. 

This went on for 18 years until it caused me to lose my wife and kids (separated), and allow them to have a better life, and also allowed me to focus on my well being.

I stopped drinking,  without trouble, and attempt a sustainable path to mental health. Without alcohol suppressing the bipolar it returned and caused the suffering to resume. I hadn’t used cannabis in a very long time and wasn’t of the same quality of person I once was. - just broken and numb to life.

I  have recently resumed using Cannabis, (with my psychiatrist approval).

I wouldn’t say I was “stoned “ when I use (1/4 joint when I felt beginning of symptoms, -rapid cycles of mania and depression) , but a sense of calmness that suppresses the rapid fluctuations of high and low. It’s still there but are able to manage the bipolar extremes till it passes,rather than a high speed extreme roller coaster it’s more of a merry go round.

When I am unable to use Cannabis, the mania part of the bi polar causes me to appear to others as being on methamphemine, not sleeping, not hungry and the craziness that stimulants have.  

I have been admitted to ICU 3 times in the last 18mts for having a “overdose” , seizures and deluded sense of reality (psychosis).
When I arrive at hospital I have had to be restrained till they can sedate me. 
I am questioned aggressively about what I have taken from the medical team and I have always denied taking anything (I understand that people will deny taking anything -even if a syringe was sticking out of there arm) and after a few hours of rest the blood tests are back and there’s no presence of drugs in my system.


I am not wanting to live a life on medications like benzodiazepines (life living death ) so live life with Cannabis making me a criminal who’s only option is to associate with the drug dealers (I only know a gang nearby that I can source it from, who also offer meth if I want it, I don’t.

These are the reasons I am willing to face prosecution and supply people in need, regardless of the law and police.


I am looking for a place where I can be honest with the property owners and have a consistent  (indoor) Cannabis supply for people who need it, I would accept full responsibility and say no one was aware of what I was doing, 

I would even like to approach the police if it was possible or maybe be a repeated nuisance if that’s what i had to do.  

Inform police ,be arrested, court, receive outcome , when sentenced , repeat and repeat and so on.
At the same time I would use any media 

I know of a group (MS suffers) that also have to buy through a gang and at market price for whatever Cannabis strain is available, and will approach the hospital oncology department when things are in place.- my fathers doctors.

So if there’s anything that you think can help I would like your input.

Thank you

dairy AND fertiliser,qkp6c5,New research shows 50 year binge on chemical fertilisers must end to address the climate crisis,newzealand,56,0.94,"[https://grain.org/e/6761](https://grain.org/e/6761)

Relevant to NZ because the widespread availability of synthetic fertilizer is a significant factor that allowed our dairy boom to occur.

[Between 1990 and 2015, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in NZ increased by 627](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-in-fertilisers)[%.](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/nitrogen-and-phosphorus-in-fertilisers)

[New Zealand also has one of the highest Synthetic N fertiliser carbon footprints per capita (tCO2e/capita) alongside Canada, Australia, Estonia (?) and Ireland.](https://grain.org/system/attachments/sources/000/006/647/original/Graph_3__2_fertilizer-map_1e.jpg)

The article notes:

&gt;Today, only around 20-30% of the synthetic N fertilisers applied to fields are converted to foods, with the rest running off into water bodies and entering the environment as pollution. Not only is this heating up the planet, but it is also destroying the ozone layer and causing a global crisis of algae blooms and oceanic “dead zones”

Which is relevant to NZ, with the state of lakes like Te Waihora and issues like whitebait extinction ([notes taken by DOC point to many commentors mentioning nitrate run off in terms of damage to white bait habitats](https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/conservation/land-and-freshwater/freshwater/report-on-whitebait-management-2018-19/notes-taken-by-doc-staff-at-12-drop-in-sessions-held-during-engagement-process.pdf)) and didymo proliferation [(this article points to high N:K ratios as a key predictor of didymo blooms](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9499-2_36))

&gt;Another key driver behind today's excessive use of N fertilisers is the ongoing decoupling of crops and livestock. A growing percentage of the world's livestock is now raised on factory farms, and feedlots that dependent on industrial animal feeds, often produced in other countries. As a result, those farms now growing feed crops utilise synthetic N fertilisers, rather than the animal manure that would have traditionally provided their fields with nitrogen

Is also relevant to our import of palm kernel extract as a winter feed.

Our entire economy is based on the availability of nitrate fertilizer, and as its price rises this will provide significant negative effects to our economy and purchasing power. As well as this, as consumers become more educated on the variety of ways that contemporary society pollutes (it's not just burning things) then our reliance on nitrate fertilizer will undermine the viability of our 'clean green' export branding, which is a significant issue when considering the rise of synthetic proteins and plant based diets.",2021-11-01,

dairy AND grass,g55q4r,Global milk prices historically track with oil prices. How will the collapse in the oil price in America effect our dairy industry ?,newzealand,29,0.71,"The relationship between world milk price and oil price has been known for many years. This is not a loose link. It is tied to the cost of production in the USA and Europe ,which is highly dependent on oil price because the herds are managed in herd homes and fed harvested feeds which all have a significant oil price component in their cost structure. Compare NZ, in which herds are managed and largely fed in grass paddocks and are not sensitive to the change in oil price.

A low USA oil price means that the USA can produce milk more cheaply than can NZ and can out-compete NZ on the international market. With an overall reduction in demand for commodities there may be a vanishing demand for international dairy products, just as the world is now experiencing a vanishing demand for oil.

Tonight at midnight, Tuesday the 21 April 2020 Global Dairy Trade, hold their next international auction of dairy products. Tomorrow morning we will have some idea what the fallout will be. 

In most countries, dairy production is consumed locally including the USA. There are only a small number of players in the international market and NZ is a major supplier. But if costs lower in the USA producers can ramp up production in one season and produce a surplus which then has to be sold on the international market.  This happens because USA's domestic milk production is massive compared to NZ's total production.  A modest surplus can eclipse NZ's total production.. These factors could make NZ's milk production uneconomic and could destroy another major sector of NZ's overseas earnings. 

I am not an expert on any of this. I am simply aware that these factors exist. I welcome any discussion,  including correction, on this topic.",2020-04-21,

dairy AND grass,sbxh7s,Memoirs of a school kid.,newzealand,89,0.94,"The year is 1997, you are at primary school and it is lunchtime.

The sun is shinning, kids are playing hop-scotch on the hot concrete, the playground is a buzz with noise and it is busy at the equpitment shed; an assortment of bats, balls, hula-hops, jump-ropes are being handed out, many faded and marked with much use.

Nearby, water splashes from a fountain and quickly evaporates as it hits the ground, making a strange noise as it does. The sports field is piled high with mounds of fortified cut grass.

You however are standing in the shade leaning up against a wall, you wait there as this is where you need to wait for what is to come. Earlier that day you took an envelope to the school office, in it was an assortment of coins and a lunch order.

You hear in the distance the familiar sound of a gate being opened, and the rumble of a car slowly approaching. Your suspicions are confirmed when a dark blue Mitsubishi Galant station wagon makes its way into view, a small crowd of kids begin to gather; cautioned by the teacher that is standing watch.

Out from the car steps a man; which you know to be the dairy owner from around the corner, he walks to the back of the car and lifts open the boot to reveal the many paper bags arranged inside cardboard boxes within. A number of the bags contain pies, sausage rolls, sandwiches, cinnamon donuts etc, there is even a box that contains an assortment of Juices. But none of these are the prize which you seek.

Your excitement begins to build.

If your stomach had a brain (as it often feels like it does) it would daydream about what is to come. Pink icing and glaze cresting an otherwise standard hotdog bun, simple enough, but to you this is peak baking. Nothing in your mind could possibly top the sticky sweet raspberry euphoria that is soon to be consumed with carefully calculated bites.

Amid the controlled chaos your name is called and your order is received with a ""hello"", a ""thank you"" and a ""goodbye"". The transaction streamlined with much practiced use, you now have what you have lusted after; a single bun selected by fate from a pack of 6.

Unbeknownst to you, years later this particular company will add coconut to the icing mix (you don't mind coconut, but it dampens the artificial raspberry flavouring that you have long enjoyed) and then eventually they will phase out the raspberry bun altogether.

Unbeknownst to you this day will one day just be a memory, one of many which will be looked back at and its simple joys.

Much like Gatsby's Green Light seen from the end of his dock the raspberry bun will remain the symbol of ""the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.

We burn things we don't have to, things we shouldn't, and things which would be better re-used in some other way.

Here's how it works:

&amp;#x200B;

(a) You're not meant to burn anything other than wood. It's strictly illegal with a small caveat of silage plastic in some areas. Don't do it. Take it to the dump or the metal recyclers.

(b) If you're a farmer, and you have a tree in a paddock taking up \~5 square meters of usable grass - consider keeping it. Otherwise animals tend to die during droughts.

(c) If you've chopped down a tree or scrub, consider donating the larger bits to your local firewood supplier - they need that stuff. Also the smaller bits, consider woodchipping and spreading the material, as NZ soils are notoriously low in carbon and this affects our meat and dairy. When you put it in the air, it doesn't help you out at all.

I hope I've presented some reasonable alternatives here to being a stone-age person.

Horrific animal abuse on the rise
Giant South Island dairy farm-owning company MilkPride Ltd has changed its plea to guilty in relation to animal cruelty charges laid by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
MilkPride had paid $9 million for the farm's stock and plant but in a little over a year the dairy herds it was carrying were in such poor condition the stock value had dropped to $2m.

The strategy, which sets out a high level framework for New Zealand's animal welfare legislation and policy, has been launched ahead of the proposed new Animal Welfare Act.
Auckland lawyer Anita Killeen wrote in last month's New Zealand Law Journal that a decade ago crimes against animals were not viewed as very important and did not deserve punishment in the same way other crimes did.

But she said a February High Court decision in which a home detention order for a farmer who broke the tails of 115 cows with a steel pipe was quashed and substituted with two years' jail, showed a shift in the value society placed on the punishment of such crimes.

""It responds to Parliament's view that cruelty to animals is abhorrent to society and its clear intention through the unanimous passage of the Animal Welfare Amendment Act 2010 to ensure that animal cruelty is to be treated seriously by the courts,"" she said.

Horror home uncovered

It was revealed this week that clients at Parklands were forced to live in crowded, dirty conditions surrounded by more than 35 small dogs, were fed inadequate food, neglected by untrained staff, provided with no meaningful activities and denied access to their own money.

In perhaps the worst example of abuse, a teenage boy who was unable to talk was regularly left unattended in a paddock to eat grass ""like an animal"".
Residents were abused by the ""bullying"" owners - Linnaire and Neil Joslin - for up to 10 years, living in fear of being beaten or sworn at if they spoke out.

The Ministry of Health confirmed yesterday it had no plans to assess how a lack of oversight at Parklands, a former home for the intellectually disabled in South Auckland that was shut down in September, allowed its owners and staff to mistreat residents for more than 10 years.

Would love to hear a good thoughtful discussion on this, I would love to know how I can get involved to further this cause in a constructive way that helps farmers and the environment. Please keep it civil, don't throw shit, just good suggestions and ideas. Thanks in advance.",2022-01-06,

dairy AND farmers,3uongs,TVNZ Sunday Dairy farming piece 29/11/2015 [my take],newzealand,98,0.76,"If anyone watched Sunday this evening please remember that it's a small minority of dairy farmers who treat their animals the way shown in the footage. Whether booby calves or heifers, all animals are essential to running the farm and so it's only a small percentage of cowboys in the industry that actually demonstrate this negligence towards stock. Don't let the sensationalism get to your head; it will be a fair argument when these animal rights groups conduct a full audit of every single dairy unit in the country, and see how the majority of farmers actually treat their stock. Don't believe the selective, sensationalist ""facts"" shown by the media to be the truth. Farmers will put the wellbeing of their stock above their own wellbeing, and find it as upsetting as anyone else when stock are in harms way. If you're feeling upset and unsure about the issue, go visit a local dairy farm, and ask the farmer if you can help out for the day; you'll get a great insight into what really goes on.

Edit: It's also important to note that the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) who regulate farming in New Zealand have been stupendously slow to act on this; especially as this footage is supposedly over two months old. This is disappointing and talking to other farming mates just now, it's pretty fucking disgusting. From what I'm seeing through the internet and from talking to people now, it seems the dairy community (and the wider agricultural community as a whole) are fairly embarrassed and disgusted by the whole matter.

p.s. I'd like to add that when I refer to cowboys, I mean it in the figurative sense of the word as in outlaw. ",2015-11-29,

TLDR of the article:
&gt;A farmer group is planning a protest at what it describes as unworkable government regulations and interference in farmers' lives.
Groundswell NZ is organising 'A Howl of a Protest' in 47 towns and cities on Friday.
Co-founder Laurie Paterson said the ""ute tax"" was the issue people pointed the finger at, but farmers were also unhappy with the bureaucratic approach to the national policy statement for fresh water management.

I'm actually pretty angry at this horse crap. This behaviour speaks to an entitled sense of elitist chauvinism, especially in light of Paterson's comments which indicate that he is most likely a climate change denier. Quote: ""I think there's quite a few agendas out there, that's the way it seems to farmers anyway."" 
RNZ wrote that Paterson indicated 'farmers were interested in what they can do to mitigate climate change but robust information was needed to base it on.' A rusty old false argument often used against the intensely researched area of climate science. Lazy libertarian farmer crap.


Peterson and his group, Groundswell, have decided that farmer's know best, and that their 'freedom' is being impinged upon by ill informed policies from bureaucratic central governments, which he says should have no say in the activities of local governments.
Laurie Paterson: ""Instead of setting up great bureaucracies to run these things we need to just let local people work with the regional councils to get the right results."" 
Which seems to be a call for private-public works devoid of national government oversight, in other words a form of libertarianism. Just what we need, Libertarian farmers Randing it up at their fountain heads.


Paterson seemed to have a lot of trouble understanding the questions from Perlina Lau, and was often ineptly evasive, changing the subject to what seems like well rehearsed hyperbole meant to come off as rural 'charm'. Or perhaps the truth is he still didn't understand the questions.


Peterson's inability to answer simple questions about his protest has left me in no doubt that this type of ""ill-informed"" (to use his phrase) protest is being made by people who have no interest in whether the science is right, or if the policies will benefit humanity. They only care about their 'freedom'. Climate change denying libertarian farmers are the worst.",2021-07-14,

It was a story about how MPI are the 'bad guys' for not paying out farmers in relation to the disease/culling of their herds.  
The farmers interviewed said if they knew this was going to happen, they wouldn't have reported. Essentially - 'Hey.. fuck NZ.. its all about us, and if we could have made more money even if it meant destroying the countries economy - then we don't give a fuck'.  
It made me really angry. Especially because the non-bullshit version of events is that MPI are taking this amount of time because so many of these farmers were not keeping records properly - and hey guess what? THATS THE FUCKING REASON THIS DISEASE SPREAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.  
Poor record keeping, poor financial management.. and hey, because we had to suffer consequences as the shit head farmers who created this situation, we would have taken back our voluntary submission and instead had the disease rampage through the country because we could of made a few more bucks.  
It was disgusting to see such a hit piece on MPI and too see our media side with some absolute SCUM. For them to say they wouldn't have let the officials know if they knew that(their poor record keeping/displaying the kind of behavior that lets this kind of disease spread) was going to cause major financial struggle - they are in the same category as terrorists and pedophiles to me.

I work from 4 in the morning to 6 at night and by the time I get home and have a shower I’m so tired that I don’t have time to clean apart from my days off but he will still come around and have a go at me about it and say his yard is pristine why isn’t mine when he is hardly even on the farm.

Please let me know if anyone else has had this experience and if I should just give up on farming all together. It just sucks as I really enjoy it but the boss is making me hate it.",2022-02-03,

But I think the time has come to make them pay. Irrigation in marginal farming areas is wrecking our rivers. They are drawing off so much water to feed their profit margins that it is altering the ecology of the whole river system. I'm hoping that a water tax will make them think twice about their water use.

Having worked on dairy farms in Canterbury, I've seen how much water these farmers draw off, and its a staggering amount, and simply not sustainable. And they always want more.

If you are a farmer who is harping on that this tax might drive you off the land, then you shouldn't be farming in marginal land. Especially in Canterbury: the conditions here are totally unsuited to dairy farming (more suited to sheep and beef), and farmers are abusing the environment just to line their pockets.

And then there are the National types who declare that farming is the backbone of our economy and must continue. What they don't seem to realise is that if farmers keep fucking the environment for short-term financial gain, there will be nothing left to farm in say 100 years.",2017-09-12,

What are the opinions of the people of the subreddit in regards to dairy farming? 

Is it having a significant effect on the environment? 

Is dairy farming ethical?

Do members of this subreddit feel that their views of milk production are lacking with modern research?

Do you think that research has a bias?
