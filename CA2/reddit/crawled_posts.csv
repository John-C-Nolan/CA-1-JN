My great aunt was pulled off the farm at 90 (she was still out there planting the garden and would help out where she could) and she declined incredibly fast and was not happy. Some people who deal with the elderly in homes should not be working there. Breaks my heart to know what she went through at the end. 

My grandfather was out there still running machinery doing light jobs and worked right up until he got pneumonia and I can tell you he was far happier to have been able to do that. Being useful and handy is very important to an old farmer.

He just isnt steady or skilled enough to drop the trees.  I took down one big fir and he looked at it and you could see he was processing how much work it was going to be and he sighed.  I told him he didn't have to do this.  They could sell this place and move into a condo.  Money isn't a factor. He told me he'd rather keel over cutting firewood there than move into a condo.

If you want to take over, it's really damn hard to get the older generation to agree to new revenue streams and changes in the operation to try and increase profits so everyone can make a living. I've seen a lot of farmers white knuckle control and their kids move on, even buy their own farms, because they couldn't find a space within Dad's operation.

Kids aren't going to take over once the elderly farmer is dead or incapable of carrying on, they'll sell because they don't know wtf they're doing. I can't understand the mindset of just carrying on and not giving you a fuck what happens after you. Succession is something that should be in every big decision you make, and it's a massive failure to have heirs who want to continue and no set plan or transition in play.

The happy medium would be to have a family member help them out on the farm. If no family members are willing or available, then you have to ease them into realizing they need help. Start small with medical devices (cane, hearing aids, life-alert, etc.). They will push back on those too, but if you can get them to try them then they start to accept the fact that they need help. Next become super interested in the farm and point out areas of improvement on the farm or things that are harming the livestock due to their inability to perform certain tasks. If it becomes about the farm as a concept or about the livestock, then they may ease up on their stubbornness. Then they may eventually become more receptive to a hired hand. Some also become more receptive when you show you care about the farm or the legacy they built.

We went through this with my grandparents. Losing the ability to do certain things is very tough for people who have otherwise been self-sufficient throughout their lives to accept. The best way is to start small and make suggestions to try to convince them to try things, but to always let it be their decision to accept help.",,13,farming

How they deal with inheritance is a well trodden and understandable experience. I’ve seen that blow apart previous generations of my family but those old timers are stubborn so all you can do is, one time, ask them
If they have determined how they want everything divided and have a will. 

They very well may shut you down there and if they do, you just need to let it go. 

My grandparents were in their 80s and 90s before they fully retired. They sold off their cattle and rented their land out to others. No muss, no fuss. I can’t fathom a “fire sale” situation, it will almost certainly the other way around - you’ll be flooded with requests to buy the land and equipment. Neighboring farmers will help sell the cattle if needed. 

It’s the likelihood of greedy relatives fighting to get their hands on a chunk of the cash cow that will probably be the biggest issue. Without a will, there nothing you can do about that. Even with a will, depending on the terms, there very well be some descendants demanding or even forcing a sale but you can’t control that. 

Your grandparents are going to do what they do and I recommend you respect their wishes, even if other family members don’t. Do the right thing and respect your grandparents wishes. It may seem that they’re not being sensible but it’s THEIR farm and THEIR call and they come from a different time so what doesn’t make sense to us makes perfect sense to them.

2. They will still have responsibilities.

Some of this is planned. There was a wealthy rancher who owned much of the rural land between Dallas and Fort Worth. He donated the land to build the freeway to the DFW airport when it was built. That gave him miles of frontage to sell off to developers. 

Some is more organic. People find a spot close to the city and things just happen.

1cq2j4l,Do farmers move to restart farming elsewhere after real estate tycoons chase them out of start building cities over farmland?,1,"The biggest problem is where these cities have sprung up. They grew up around the farming community that settled in the area, then took off on their own life with manufacturing and trade. Almost a third of DFW airport is on my old family land. Farming took a turn for the worse in the 50’s with a big drought, and grandfather had a trucking company hauling his own milk, supplies, and equipment, so he poured his time into that, building what was, at the time, the worlds largest trucking company. He sold off part of the dairy to help fund it. But he did well. 

And the area around that place grew. Taxes increased, as well as population, and costs. Grandfather sold more land, as he bought other places in New Mexico, North Texas, and Oklahoma. Diversification. But the population kept growing in DFW. The last large (ish) tract was half a section, and in the mid 90’s, they ran a highway through it, I think deliberately, to break it up. Almost all gone now.

If you’re worried about that, try looking at an area a little outside a smaller town.

They ended up taking a reduced offer and buying a place four times bigger about 40 miles outside of the metro area. 

When we moved to the new place there were four other houses on our two mile road. All but one were other farms. We were about seven miles from a tiny town. 

Fast forward to today. Family drama split our place in half. There are over 30 new houses on our road. The tiny town has turned into a big town. There are 8 housing developments between our place and town. Only two places are still farmed. Ours and our direct neighbor. We both lease to a young farmer. The neighbors place recently sold to a truck dealership and last week there were dozers in his field. There are plans to put a major road through the corner of our property in the future. The icing on the cake, Bill Gates bought everything across the road from us, over 10,000 acres.

1cpy6eo,Do people actually get deathly lost in cornfields?,0,"It's certainly easy to get lost, especially in large coverage areas. The thing that I experienced as a kid that most people don't realize is that from an auditory perspective, you don't have to get too far into dense fields to lose directionality. When stalks are 7ft / 2ish meters, most people lose line of sight for obvious reasons and likewise line of sound because of the huge biomass that is dampening vibrations and reflections. 

I grew up in an area unlike the midwest plains so we had hills that could serve as landmarks if you got disoriented, but I'd hate to wake up nekkid in a 1000 acre Kansas corn field and have to find my way out without landmarks. The average corn farm in Kansas is 781 acres, or just a bit over a mile square. It's not going to kill you during growing season (aside maybe from getting run over by an automated combine) but it sure would make for a miserable day. The largest corn farms in the midwest reach 2700 acres, which would be a square of just over 2 miles per side.

I'd imagine there are clever ways that the locals have to prevent that like GPS and digital mapping, but dumping some poor urban sap (me included) into the middle of it all could be a pretty unpleasant experience. To be candid, I'd be more worried about running into wildlife along natural waterways that are likely to run through larger stretches of crops. Sounds like an adventure to me.

As for dying, people experience that for all sorts of stress and weather related reasons. I wouldn't worry about cold exposure toooo much overnight while wandering into a field. Heat exposure during the day can definitely be a problem, especially if you don't have a source of water. The fields are sown to have airflow, but spending all day in partial sunlight with high humidity can really cut short that bucket list. Also, someone with anxiety, a weak heart, diabetic, or with relevant pollen or mold allergies could certainly vulnerable.

**Explanation:** While there are fields that can reach a mile or over in size, most are *not* that size and are smaller. Even then, corn is planted in straight rows, so if you just simply go straight and follow a row, you will find your way out fairly quickly.


Horror movies also tend to get it very wrong when it comes to the space between rows. Corn is planted very close together typically, as not only can you fit more, but corn is prone to uprooting/falling over in high winds without support. Plant corn closer together and they support each other and air cannot flow as much between them. 95% of the time, you are *not* comfortably running between rows of corn... you are getting slapped by cobs/leaves, probably getting your feet caked in heavy, sticky mud, and getting all kinds of spiders, stinkbugs, and worms all in your hair and clothes. Seriously, the rows are typically not wide enough for you to comfortably put your feet side-by-side.

(Just kidding.)

But in all seriousness, there are MASSIVE fields where I’m from and not a ton of tall landmarks (like trees or buildings) visible once you’re inside due to the corn all being 2-3 feet higher than your head— so if you aren’t paying attention, you could lose track of where you entered and get turned around, potentially heading deeper into the fields (for miles and miles) instead of towards a road. If you aren’t continuing in a straight line (i.e. cutting through rows in an effort to create more distance or concealment) you could actually wind up going in circles before long, especially if you aren’t being strategic about it.

But like others say here, the more urgent issue is the heat, dust, etc., once you’re inside. It can be pretty stifling on a hot day, not a ton of air flow, which could cause disorientation and/or panic for someone who is dehydrated, already struggling to breathe (from running from the bad guy, for example), or claustrophobic. A child or senior adult getting lost in a field would definitely be cause for concern.

The movies probably like it as a trope both for visual effects AND because cornfields have a strange way of making you feel boxed in and incredibly vulnerable at the same time. Your vision is partially obscured, there is a weak barrier/wall of corn offering no physical security but limited concealment from your enemy (like a curtain that could be swept back at any time to reveal something hiding behind it), your hearing can be impaired and your movements limited by the sound of rustling leaves, there are bugs, snakes, and potentially other critters in the field with you, so you’re “alone” but not alone… And don’t get me started on the scarecrows and aliens! 👽

Sit down with your relatives wife and go through the books very carefully.

Perhaps most significant for economic development, Kazakhstan also has the 11th largest proven reserves of both petroleum and natural gas.[65] One such location is the Tokarevskoye gas condensate field.

Once you have done a full systemic survey and review of the property for mining potential, seek out those potentials if there are any.

OP mentions that he is flying from germany. When Operation Barbarossa happened and Hitler invaded the volga republic the USSR accepted a lot of german refugees into Kazakhstan where they did a lot of farming at the behest of the soviet govt using chemical fertilizers and aral sea water, which left the land pretty full of salt. Most of them went back to germany after the berlin wall fell and they were granted the right of return. OP is probably part of that group, so the land he or she is returning to has probably been pretty badly mistreated for the last 80 years. Land that is already degraded is where you want to stick things like mining operations rather than destroying actual pristine land. 

If we start from an inference based on info we have (OPs country of residence and familial connection to Kazakhstan) it's better than just assuming it is pristine land, but direct evidence or evaluation would be even better still. If your knee jerk reaction is just to declare land pristine then you are diluting calls to protect pristine land through a 'boy who cried wolf' effect and if it's not and you do manage to protect it you haven't stopped mining, you've just moved it to land that is either less polluted and degraded, or more valuable as wildlife habitat.",,1,farming

You can look ahead and fulfill integral roles in tomorrows activity by simply being prepared for the things you know will be necessary. Some days that may be as simple as knowing he won’t have time to look up, much less time to prepare a lunch for himself. Meet him at the point of his needs.
Sometimes we men hurl headlong into a project by sheer bullheadedness and don’t even remember to take a jug of water cause we are so focused on the problems we have ahead.
Also we sometimes need to be able to talk through the situation with a reasonable sounding board and being a good listener can be a critical component to our thought process. 
Having a peaceful Santorum to come home to is nice also. The stress of the day can be magnified by strife at home or home can be a place of respite. Largely this is in direct relationship to the woman of the house. Give him a space to come home and let his guard down. Be his safe space. Low drama, friendship, comfort, peace, solidarity. Be his partner in saving money at every opportunity and be the leader on family nutrition, family doctoring, family functioning, socialization with extended family, neighbors and township. 
Be remindful of things he’s possibly forgotten, like that thing he promised the old lady down the road he’d help with, or that your engine light came on today or that you noticed a strange noise began recently so he doesn’t have to wait till it breaks down and he can maybe head off trouble before it gets to be a bigger problem. 
Bloom where you’re planted and make the best of the things you have. Encourage him where you feel he needs it and keep a positive attitude when things go wrong and by the way they will. A lot. Failure is a part of this thing. Getting back up and trying again is how we survive. Whatever you do, do it as a team. Right or wrong, success or failure, it was yours together. In 50 years you’ll be stronger than ever and a backbone in your community and family. 
Whatever happens stick to each other. Be sure and face your problems together and not turn your guns inward on each other. Stress causes us to do strange things sometimes, be mindful of that and realize the two of you fight the problems and not each other. It’s not a competition it’s a completion. Be complementary like two puzzle pieces that are different shapes yet fit together to make a whole. 

A man is like a hammer and a woman is like a tea cup. They have different purposes.

1cp4mk9,Farmer's wife needs some advice,0,"One of The best ways to help is to start by asking questions!  How Can I Help? When should I do X?  

What should I NOT do? 

KEEP THE BOOKS! ( this is another subject completely, but critically important to the long term financial stability of the farm!  ) 

Haul Feed, Seed and Fertilizer.  

Make parts runs.

Call the fuel company. 

Call the Veterinarian and be ready and available to show the Vet where the sick or injured animal is.  

Program the Vet, Mill, Fuel phone numbers into the contact list on EVERY phone! 

Can you use an extra set of hands to help hold the parts together while you are working on it? Can I hand you a tool just when you need it, if you show me which one you will need in advance and teach me its name?  

Can you teach me how to run the machine? If you can drive a car you can learn to drive a tractor or a loader, even the farm - GASP  - Semi-Tractor Trailer!!  ( you actually don’t need a CDL for ON FARM use, I have seen 13yo’s drive them back and forth between the fields and the barn, NOT to town or the mill/market though ) start with the simple tasks like raking hay, moving bales, or scraping the manure out of the barn.  

Can you show me how to start the power washer and use it to clean the tractor, loader, shop floor Ect. 

Please teach me how to blend the feed ( usually adding minerals to the basic forage - take notes and measure carefully, it just like baking a cake but on a much larger scale! ) and feed the animals. 

Bring snacks, and seasonally appropriate beverages ( for some farmers I know that may be Mountain Dew when he’s working outside in a Blizzard, you just need to figure out what he wants! ) and complete meals to the field during planting and harvest seasons.  

But perhaps the best thing you can do for him is LOVE HIM, and MAKE LOVE to HIM, any time of the day and EVERYWHERE on the farm! A quickey in the hay goes a long way! Don’t push it on him, just make sure that he knows that you are Ready and Willing whenever he has the desire!",,3,farming

The best support may be taking care of things in the house so that he can do his work without worrying about a meal or clean clothes so you to divide the labor fairly and clearly. Following the traditional model is probably the easiest. There is a reason why that's been done for centuries. For tasks that you don't have the skill for watch you tube how to videos. You do need all the skills including plumbing, carpentry, heavy machine operating maintenance and repair in case he gets injured you will have to pick up his work so you have an income while you figure things out. So the skill set needs to be there in case you need it.

Patience was mentioned. Don't be demanding. Both need to give in a relationship but long hours mean you will probably feel lonely and left out until you adjust to the new lifestyle. It means having things ready and done when he does have time, so you don't have to do house chores when he's done with his chores. It takes time to adjust to the new life style. It took me several years even though I hung out at horse farms when I was a kid. Having my own place was totally different. Both me and my husband have the same skill sets. So the years I made the transition from city living happened before I met him. So when we moved out of the city where he was living he had to undergo that same skill building and lifestyle adjustment. So it isn't just knowledge that's the thing you have to learn, you also have to make emotional adjustments and adaptations which take a lot longer.

I find that my husband and most other men tend to be impatient and gruff when intently working on something. So it's best to wait for them to ask for help if they are like that when they get focused. I think the reason is the way they focus it's disruptive to have that focus disrupted. Many women have a multitasking ability and I think this is more so than men usually have or at least the men I have lived with and known. I know it's steriotypy but I think that understanding this will help you help him if he has this psych make up where he intensely focuses on his task and dislikes interruption. In that situation he needs space. Someone helping may be more irritating and distracting which breaks the focus and requires a fair mental effort to regain the "" zone""

This is why tasks need to be delegated, shared and clearly communicated before you go out to your chores. It minimizes interruptions and helps things go more smoothly during the day. If things go sideways then stop and adjust don't try to work. Once you get into a work flow it will be easier and when things happen you both know what to do.",,2,farming

Having worked farms, there are always things that need fixed and fabricated. Go take a welding course or two at the local community college. You don’t need the certificate, just the knowledge and someone to walk you through your technique. 

Talk to your husband and ask him “If there was one small part of the farm that ate up your time and took your focus off of what you think is important, what would that be?” The answer to that question is the thing you have to learn as much about as possible and focus on taking that off his hands.",,1,farming

My husband does a lot of what youre saying you already do (brings lunch and drinks, helps fix things, odd runs for parts) and it is immensely helpful. My only issue is if i have to stop what Im doing and explain to him how to do a job. It usually takes me longer to explain it than to just do it myself, which ends up taking time away from other things I need to be doing. So during the winter when things are a bit calmer he asks what he can learn or what I have time to teach him. 

For me the biggest thing is once we get into spring, im up at 530 every single day to let the chickens out with the sunrise (yes i know about auto door openers but i dont like them for reasons, plus the health of my chickens is important so morning is my best shot at seeing if someone is hurt or sick) and then I dont go back in the house until lunch basically. Recently, my husband offered me a few 'sleep in' days a month where he will get up earlier than he needs to for his job and let the chickens out for me.

Things have value if and only if people agree that those things have value. It’s true of gold. It’s true of diamonds. It’s true of fiat currency. No government, by threat of violence or anything else can change that (either making things have or not have value). 

The whole WORLD agrees that US currency has value. Surely you’re not saying that they believe that purely under the threat of violence? Sure we have a powerful military but that’s not what makes us the reserve currency for the world. Rather it’s our economic output and stability. 

Surely you agree that all SORTS of trade occurs without currency changing hand all the time. Currency (fiat or otherwise) is just a convenient carrier of value so we don’t have to physically barter. It works so long as it works. If it stops working there’s no power on earth that can simply make it start working again (see Zimbabwe).

You have to understand that in any given year there are +\- 90 million acres of corn and soybeans each.  For corn thats 16 billion bushels.  Over 900 billion pounds of just corn.  Spread over most of the United States.  

Once harvested let’s say all the grain goes into commercial storage, it doesn’t a lot stays on the farm for a period of time but for this exercise let’s say it all goes immediately into commercial storage.  The largest elevator (where grain is sold and stored) is about 20 million bushels.  So it would take over 800 elevators to store that corn.  That’s a lot of sites.  And the number of elevators in the states is in the thousands minimum.  Our grain supply is very safe and stable.  

Now, today most tractors and combines REQUIRE computers to operate.  The percentage of the fleet of equipment that does the actual farm work is becoming more and more dependent on electronics.  Very, very, very few machine are purely mechanical any more.  I bet there aren’t 2000 tractors and combines combined that don’t have some sort of necessary computer in them that could do any amount of work and that’s being extremely generous.
So, as in most aspect of our society, an EMP bomb would absolutely cripple agriculture.  180 million acres of corn and beans and another I don’t even know acres of wheat could rot in the fields.  Cattle would probably be fine.  Most pigs would probably be fine. Most commercially raised chickens would be dead within a couple hours.  Chickens even on a small commercial farm are housed in barns that require ventilation to clear the ammonia fumes from their excrement.  Produce farms would probably make it as there is still a lot of that work done by hand. Still, people wouldn’t make it 3 months before they starved.",,1,farming

1cp1806,Will autonomous farming be a Problem in the future?,0,"Autonomy is going to increase the demand for skilled labor and decrease the demand for unskilled labor. 


I have an equipment background and can tell you that you can throw any greenhorn in most pieces of equipment and at the minimum they will notice when big things start to go wrong. 


But with autonomy, the machinery theoretically will notice/fix the big issues on the fly or notify the farm manger. So now we don’t need unskilled greenhorns - we need someone smarter than the machine capable of setting the equipment, remotely monitoring for precise adjustments, and capable of replicating this over several machines at once. 


The scary part here is that those types of skilled laborers already work for larger farms. I suspect we will see consolidation speed start to increase, as one good hand is now capable of managing much more equipment at one time. This will drive down per-acre costs for larger farms, allowing them to acquire more ground easily. 


There is one saving grace - I believe a lot of autonomous technology will come at a per-acre cost. This sort of levels the playing field as every person will be paying the same amount per acre for use of the technology.

Cameras in front that read the ground, ID a weed, calculate speed and location as you travel over it then when the weed is under a nozzle it selects the right herbicide and applies a tiny amount in the precise spot it needs to go. 

Part of the sales pitch for it is that you don't need to be endlessly cleaning out tanks on the spray rig, because it carries all of your options each in its own tank all at once so you only refill as needed, not switch the contents. Rather like a colour printer really.

Massive reductions in input cost, better for the environment, less cleaning and maintenance, and supposedly much more effective... But it still needs a driver in the seat and someone to fuel and service it.

For crops half is corn and half contracted to the canning company.  But has been starting to do hay as well to keep options open plus more hay equals less ground to prep every year.  Overall doing better, less stressed, and making more money in the end generally.",,1,farming
1co9smm,Life after Dairy… ,0,"Your state dept of ag, university ag extension program, conservation district may have a ""farm mediation"" or ""farm transition"" program that has and can help you navigate all these tough questions. My state also has a farmer peer counseling service, where farmers help other farmers with the mental/emotional burdens. If you haven't found anything like this, reach out to any contacts at the aforementioned spots. They'll know of any similar programs or will be able to advocate the need for these programs in the future. Best of luck!",,1,farming
1co9smm,Life after Dairy… ,0,"If no one is interested in continuing with dairy then id say might aswell sell the cows, its not for everyone to have dairy animals and it takes a lot of time, patience, care and interest to have a functioning dairy farm. If you still want animals just not milk them you can always raise beef cows or get some sheep. (Disclaimer: that was a joke dont get sheep)",,1,farming
1co9smm,Life after Dairy… ,1,Yeah… Beef might be the plan but for now I’m focused on Row crops as my area is all grain and lots of options for selling. I think diversifying is the way to do it long term but initially I think Corn/Soybeans are the goal. Kinda boring but it pays the bills.,,2,farming
1co9smm,Life after Dairy… ,0,"We sold out our cows when I was a sophomore in high school in 1989. It was very sad to see them go. Anyone that has grown up on a small dairy knows that they are all named and family. 
Immediately, it was like a weight was  lifted.
No more running to the “honking” school bus with wet hair and shoes in hand.
20 years later with kids in high school, we bought an old jersey cow for my son to milk by hand. My daughter did her senior “project” on all of the things you can make from milk.
Soap, yogurt, butter, cheese……..
When it’s in your blood, it’s in your blood.
Good luck and I wish the best for your family

1co9smm,Life after Dairy… ,0,Because of the fact that you are asking for information in Reddit tells me that you don’t deserve anything. Sell it and split any profits that might be left.,,-9,farming
