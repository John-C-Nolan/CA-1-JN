dairy AND cap,smq3nh,Cattle herd size ireland,ireland,21,0.27,"So I am wondering what's being done and when about the total number of cattle in Ireland in relation to our greenhouse gases and targets.

It's a social taboo to discuss it in rural Ireland but to reach our targets there is no way around it other that herd size reduction. It's obviously very sad for anyone involved in farming as it's a way of life, I'm not trying to make a moral call here I just want to get a look into the future.

The Greens are very quiet on the matter as far as I can tell, nothing on the green party website. I know the cap might change things and if so when?

dairy AND price,16sikmw,"Was charged 1.20 for non dairy milk in a coffee shop this weekend , and 10.20 in total for two coffees. I can’t be the only one thinking this is robbery?",ireland,733,0.87,"Myself and the wife will usually head into town every few weeks of a Saturday for a walk around and a bit if shopping.

We would usually grab some lunch but have mostly stopped this due to the price increases and cheap ingredients a lot of places have switched to, but we would always grab a take out coffee for our walk around. 

We went in Saturday for the first time in a few weeks and I ordered our usual two coffee and hers with Oat milk as she is lactose intolerant and can’t drink dairy. 

Wasn’t paying too much attention as I was chatting with the girl at the counter so just tapped my phone and then noticed the price was 10.20. I looked at the menu and sure enough the coffees had gone up to 4.50 each so I asked about the extra 1.20 thinking I was overcharged. 

Girl told me no, they had a VAT increase recently and all prices went up and the milk went from 50cent to 1.20€. 

Checked back on my payments are last time we went (about 6 weeks ago) I paid 8.50 and now it’s 10.20. 

Told your one I thought 10.20 was scandalous for two coffees and she said that a few people had mentioned it, but didn’t want to start anything big with a minimum wage employee who has no control over prices. 

I work from home so tend to drink coffee at home during the week, so Saturday in town was probably the only one I’d get out and I enjoyed supporting a local business but fuck me there seems to be a right level of greed in some Irish business right now and charging 1.20 for a milk substitute for someone who actually needs it is terrible. 

Anyway sorry for the rant but I’m just sick of greedy businesses, because this place also stuck up all their prices when the levy on disposable cups came in regardless of if you had a keep cup or not.",2023-09-26,

I remember I used to get it a lot in a  newsagent in a fairly nice part if Dublin. You'd get a lot of really wealthy people trying to get deals or refusing to pay the full price of a dairy milk. It happened with cinema and plane tickets as well. It would happen very often.

dairy AND price,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.76,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

dairy AND price,23uln2,One Year a Paddy: Reflections on Ireland from a Yank,ireland,151,0.86,"I moved from the USA to Ireland a little over a year ago and wanted to post some of my thoughts about the island.

* When I first moved over, I didn't know what to expect.  My family's not Irish, so I had no preconceived notions of hunting down long lost relatives or visiting a small ancestral cottage in Kerry.  I've found when I tell people I'm not of Irish descent, they almost always like me right away.    I guess this speaks to just how annoying many tourists must be.

* On that topic I have, surprisingly, had many people tell me about their family that moved to America, and got to experience just how boring it is hearing someone else's family history.

* The variation in accents is fascinating to me.  How could such a small place have such different ways of talking?  Whenever I would meet someone who's accent I hadn't heard before, say Cork or Carlow, I would always be dumbfounded and find them incomprehensible.

* A lot of people ask me if Irish people are really as big into drinking as the stereotype suggests.  The thing is that if you don't go to the pub, at least every once and a while, people will consider you weird.  I've always liked going out to drink, and don't find that people drink more necessarily, but that it's social protocol to go out to the pub.

* On that note, Guinness really is much different here than it is in the US.  I would rarely drink it before I moved here, but now won't drink anything else.

* The amount of litter is always amazing to me.  I understand that on a Saturday morning the sidewalk around a chipper is going to be a mess, but it goes beyond that.  People will throw trash anywhere.  The state of rivers in even a small town is evidence of how little people seem to care about making an otherwise picturesque place look like garbage.

* The meats and dairy products, specifically lamb, are something to be proud of.   I can't tell you how nice it is compared to what we have in America.  Milk too, and I come from a state that people brag about their milk.  I know it's getting better, but I've always found the dairy aisles funny for the sheer amount of cheddar and no other type of cheese.  I remember telling friends, ""You guys know  there's more than one type of cheese, right?""

* The people are great.  75% of them, anyways.  They'll take time out of their day to show you how to get somewhere and then say you should come by for tea.  Irish moms are the best.  When I first moved over I wondered why people honked so much, assuming people were very angry drivers.  It took me a while to figure out they were saying hello to a friend walking down the street.  25% of the people, though, are just gigantic assholes that wouldn't spit on you to put out a fire because they don't like your face and when they get drunk...

* Everyone knows EVERYONE.  I can't tell you how many times I've overheard two strangers have this conversation in a pub: ""Oh sure, your mom is my neighbor's cousin's barber.  Sure, I know about you.""

* There's something I have started to call ""Irish Time.""  Someone says meet you at 9 it means 9:15, someone tells you a couple of days it means a week, you need paperwork from the government and they say it will take a month or two then may God have mercy on your soul.

* The price of some things are astounding.  Car insurance is how much?  You have to pay to HAVE a TV?  I couldn't believe it.  Never take for granted, though, how great it is to only have to pay 50 euro to see a doctor without insurance.

* Hatred towards Travellers is shocking to me.  I know it's a controversial subject, but to me, it's embarrassing for all parties involved.

* Before I moved to Ireland I could count the number of times I went to church on my fingers.  Since moving here I've been to mass six or seven times, and I'm not even Catholic.   

* I think a lot of Irish people like to talk bad about their country.  They don't like it an want to move to Australia as soon as they get a chance.  They think that if you don't live in Dublin that life will be a nightmare.  I personally think that there is so much to be proud of.  It is a truly unique country with some of the best people you'd ever like to meet.",2014-04-24,

dairy AND price,b2wovf,Observations On Your Island and People (from a corny American who just got back),ireland,279,0.94,"Hot damn! I spent 9 days in Ireland. Here's a few things I learned and observed.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You're nowhere NEAR as drunk as the media would have folks believe. Not that I went over there thinking you'd all be tripping over your own feet and puking in the street. It's just that lots of mislead Americans who claim Irish heritage blame their excessive boozing on their blood. Nope! Try again.
2. You're really happy and I love that. When I visited France, the scowling was very real. If I smiled at a stranger, there was a palpable and immediate disdain. In Ireland, a smile begets a smile. Further, people bade me good morning before I even said a word. Lovely! I'm from the American South, and we're like that too. Very warm and welcoming. It was so nice.
3. You have WiFi everywhere! Not that I'm glued to my phone, believe you me, but in order to avoid costly international text/calling, it's crucial to be connected. Our country could seriously take a page from that book.
4. Speaking of pages from your book, the bathrooms in Ireland ... I can't see through huge gaps alongside the doors and it makes all the sense in the world. I'm not sure why American bathrooms aren't like this, but it's sadistic.
5. What's with the Coors Light everywhere, haha? I lived in Denver for 3 years and it was huge there (because it's brewed there), but it was really funny seeing it front and center in your country. No hate: It's an easy-drinking, no-frills brew. Just funny that it's so brand specific.
6. You really, REALLY know how to cook some fish. From the smoked mackerel I had ... to the kickass fish pies, wow. Exquisite.
7. It's very spiritual there, and I'm not even a spiritual person. I visited lots of ancient sites and felt absolutely awed by the age and the reverence beneath my feet. Even your ""ten-pound castles"" were things of glory.
8. Your green is greener than green. Your blue waters are bluer than blue. It's IMPOSSIBLE to take a bad picture in Ireland.
9. Black and white pudding is fan-fucking-tastic and I hate that it's non-existent where I am. I looked on Amazon to see if it's available, and I got some shitty version that's WAY outta price range.
10. Your water is also fan-fucking-tastic. Right outta the tap, it's pure and delicious. Silky.
11. Your motorways aren't filled with cops, and people seem to behave themselves. Huh.
12. You love a good story in your music. It reminds me of American country music, which I actually like. It's nice to get woven a tale as you tap your feet. Another observation goes to songs that had meaning I never knew about, for example: ""Where the Streets Have No Name,"" and how the locals would remove streetsigns to confuse the English who came to collect some of your folks for (I assume) internment? Correct me if I'm wrong; I'd rather know.
13. Your food sizes are enormous! It's weird to say that as a Yank, but it's true: Order some stew or fish/chips and you're gonna have leftovers. (I love it.)
14. The Guinness seems stronger there. I literally was buzzing halfway through a pint.
15. I cried twice in Derry walking the streets and learning about what happened. Man. Hugs all around. Tragic.  Here's to it never happening again.
16. Belfast is still very heavy. It feels like the plumes of war are still overhead, dissipating though they may be. However! I had the most knowledgeable bartender I've ever had there. His name was Robert (Bob-a-licious as his cohorts called him) and he gave us the ins and outs of whiskey/scotch/bourbon. This was at Lavery's Bar. Bless you, sir.
17. Your crows are things of beauty with their silver eyes and far-gentler ""caws"" when compared to ours. I was enamored for some reason and got lots of video. Here's a pic I took in Clonmacnoise: [https://imgur.com/a/XYlPwbO](https://imgur.com/a/XYlPwbO)
18. The Antrim coast ... ""fecking"" wow. WOW.
19. Of all the cities, I think Athlone was the most fun for me. I really like laid-back places, so it was tops. Kilkenny is next, as I dug the castle and Kyteler's Inn (for its ""witchy"" background and steak sandwich, which was insane).
20. Your teas and desserts are shameful. Thank you. So good. My favorite was an ""apple sponge with custard."" Holy shit. Ho. Ly. Shit.
21. VIVA TAYTOS! (And Hunky Dory.) Cheese and Onion for both.
22. Your dairy is spectacular! I really loved the Cashel Bleu and Dubliner.
23. I don't wanna thank Storm Gareth, but I will say that it made a few spots on my trip more exciting in retrospect.
24. A shoutout for teaching me ""bad words"" in Irish and telling me they meant ""good morning."" I wonder how many people I told to kiss my ass as I went out for breakfast. HAHAHAHA! God. You guys ...
25. Just thanks in general. That was absolutely marvelous. I'll be back for more, hopefully with more of a County Kerry bent.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I did:

\- partied in Temple Bar (of course)

\- peeped out Swords Castle

\- checked out Trinity College/Book of Kells/The Long Room

\- toured Kilmainham Gaol

\- walked Christchurch Cathedral

\- toured Dublinia

\- visited the Hill of Tara

\- slapped the rocks at Goward Dolmen

\-  gawked at the architecture in Belfast

\- toured Belfast City Hall

\- marveled at the waves comin' into Ballintoy Harbor

\- walked the Giant's Causeway (during Gareth, which was terrifying and exhilarating)

\- walked around Derry and read about her struggle

\- visited Navan Centre

\- walked the grounds of Clonmacnoise, which REALLY hit a chord (so old and beautiful!)

\- walked the grounds of the Rock of Cashel, which feckin' ruled for the same reasons Clonmacnoise did

\- learned of Kilkenny's past walking around ... seems y'all never could catch a break!

\- visited Kilkenny Castle ... a restored marvel

\- toured Rothe House ... another beauty, esp. the gardens

\- went back to Dublin for a rowdy pre-St. Paddy's dinner/drink-sesh ... then flew home

It was a trip of a lifetime and I have so many ""grand"" locals to thank for the memories. The amount of kindness and warmth was unlike anything else I've experienced while traveling.

I did have ONE bad run-in on the last night with a guy so drunk that his friends apologized for him, which was sweet but unnecessary. I saw where he was coming from ... he said (to paraphrase) that Americans coming over was like having the English refuse to leave. (I honestly laughed heartily, thinking he was kidding. Not so much.) Anyway, one of his buddies said it's a good thing people come here, for obvious reasons. No worries. Even in this sub, there are two schools of thought on the matter.

That's it! I can only hope that if any of y'all wanna come visit The South here, you'd know you can call on me to reciprocate the warmth and hospitality. I'd love to show some folks around.

(And no: I didn't bring any Snickers, you cheeky nerds. Hahaha. You almost got me before I left, though.)

dairy AND price,xc90tp,New Policies By The Leprechaun Council Part 1,ireland,7,0.25,"Disclaimer: The following is a sarcastic take on the way people are getting fleeced in the country. The content of this article should not be taken as a professional recommendation by any unprofessional politicians who are running this place to the ground. If they do implement these as laws, please don't blame me... 


The grand council of Leprechauns has identified that the current issues faced by the people of Ireland stem from four main elements. 

1. A lack of housing 

2. The inflation in the market 

3. Lack of infrastructure (public transportation, energy production, schools , hospitals  , a functional airport or roads without potholes) 

4. Lack of money that is available to spend on the above. 

In order to combat these issues , we have devised a series of measures that should solve these problems. 

1.  A Graveyard Tax: 

It has come to our attention that alot of prime real estate is being taken up by the graves of people who are dead. Every individual is taking up a space of almost 20 square foot of space in a grave site. That's more space than a typical student accommodation! 

At this rate, we will have most of the land taken over by graveyards within a few centuries. So we hereby propose that every individual who wants to have a graveyard of the standard size , establish a trust fund that will pay a graveyard tax to the government in perpetuity. The fund needs to take into consideration the inflation trend and account for a 20% increase in estimated costs every year the graveyard will be occupied. Should your fund run out or you become delinquent in the payment, then the corpse will be exhumed and processed into bone meal for the gardens of the tech companies who are keeping the country afloat. 

For those who don't have the facility to pay said graveyard tax, you will have the option of a viking burial ( toss your corpse out on the ocean on a plyboard and light it up). This option will be subject to a carbon tax , depending on how much smoke you emit as your corpse burns. However, in the current market rend , we are sure you would have withered down to your bones due to the cost of living and hence your carbon tax would probably be covered by your pension fund. 

Another alternative for those who want to ensure their loved ones have a place to visit, is the tower of eternal slumber. This will be a multistory tower where each deceased individual will be intered in a block sized coffin and it will be arranged like Jenga blocks to ensure maximum space efficiencty. Our biggest sponsor , Demazon has offered to provide their expertise in warehouse management to help us build this structure. This however comes with a rental cost and if your loved ones are unable to pay the rent then your remains will become the property of Demazon to use as they see fit { Message from our sponsor: Demazon is now offering Fertilizer, pet food and calcium supplements at exciting prices }

If you have no money whatsoever and your loved ones are already burdened with the struggles of day to day living, then you have the exciting opportunity to volunteer yourself as a lab test subject to any of our pharmaceutical partners. This option will allow you to do your part for the future of humanity and the company would happily provide you with a vertical grave as a permanent resting place. Recent studies have shown the benefits of standing rather than sitting or sleeping. So these firms will offer you an ergonomically vertical graveyard after they have used your body for their nefarious purposes. 

2. Tax On Unauthorized Expulsion Of Gaseous Waste ( Fart /burp tax) 

Our minister for purple energy has identified that emissions of methane in all forms is a significant contributor to global warming. While the current measures are already working on taxing the farmers to their bones and making them take a shotgun to their cattle; we need to expand our carbon tax further. 

Henceforth, every individual would be expected to pay a fart tax along with their PRSI , USC , TV Tax, VAT  and the arbitrary taxes we come up with , promise to remove after a while but never do. The fart tax would be paid based on an estimated emission of fart based on your age , size , dietary pattern and dairy consumption. You will ofcourse have to do most of the work in calculating these and entering relevant information in our revenue website. At the end of the year, you will have to submit notarized affadavits to claim any fart free periods. When you purchase beans , dairy or other items that have been linked to causing said emissions, you will be taxed additionally at the checkout counter. Restaurants serving foods that cause flatulence will have the option of levying the tax on your bill. 

We will be conducting random assessment on your gaseous emission to ensure you are within your limits. An inspector will follow you around with a fart meter behind you and will give an assessment on your emmision level. 

Alternatively, you can install a smart fart meter on your rear that would directly link your emmision to our system. 


The tax will have provision to further expand into a breathing tax which is currently being researched. It has come to our attention that individuals who breathe are causing more expenses than those who don't for the government. Hence we will soon be expanding this tax to incentivize people to stop breathing. Remember,these taxes are a measure to incentivize positive behavior, not make money off you...

dairy AND price,ep8f7i,2000 Kilometers around Ireland - A great journey &amp; my thoughts,ireland,22,0.87,"Dear irish people and ireland lovers,

in September 2019 i sat myself in the plane to Dublin, rented a car and started to explore the island for 7 days without pretty much research about famous sights and things. This might be sound strange in the 21st century with Phones´n Apps´n Net, but it´s way more fun to figure out what people and locals tell you on the road.. or sometimes unfortunately not. Of course, completly without phone is unconvenient. Especially with maps, airbnb and food spots. But making plans on the road works pretty fine for me for some years already and meeting and hanging out with local people is the best.

The trip started immediately incredibly good.. Jeez, irish people are so welcoming, heartwarming and nice, that i felt very cozy on that small and sometimes creepy roads and cottages. I thought, it might be war on those tiny roads, but they´re all so polite drivers and i swear, in 2k Kilometers i only freaked out 1 or 2 times, while furious road rage and shouting at people is a speciality in germany, where i´m from, btw. Almost everyone is greeting or waving at you (in a friendly way) and if there´s a question about anything, well.. Don´t dare to ask. It seemed like i found the goldpot on the end of the rainbow before i even slid it down and high fived the goblin... Already on day No.1!

I met incredibly nice characters, of all facettes and ages that i´m feeling like a fanboy telling all my friends that i was in ireland and compare each country now with ireland like i´m Howard Wollowitz who came lately from space. There was Phil the dairy farmer or Brigid the shepherd.. and so many more. Those 7 days was actually a constant hussle. Everyday booking and finding a new airbnb (which wasn´t that cheap btw), doing the new route, recording vlogs.. But it doesn´t felt like it was stressful. I enjoyed almost every minute with all the people i met and the perfect nature i saw. For sure, i´m very focused on meeting people and wanna see how they live and learn about their culture. That´s why i drove 95% countryroads, visiting each little village where sometimes the center was only one house with some dogs. But it´s time consuming. For 250Km way by car, you´re on the track for 3-4h. And this brings me to the most important point: Time management. I think i did the best with the time i had. In 7 days i had like 2 very rainy and one slight rainy day. The 2 bad ones i used to stick more on the road and approach the west of the island earlier (which was a very nice move, turned out later) and that other day i was really mad, because it destroyed my experience in Galway, which i skipped after being bloody wet. But all in all i was lucky and got accostumed to wind and quick weather changes pretty fast. Sometimes i still have this fine sea breeze in my nose.. Which i like so damn much. Anyway. The car gives such an huge advantage, especially when it comes to the airbnbs, which was -in my case- everytime located in the deepest countryside and yes.. The first and second approach to my cozy beds led me through mysterious and ancient roads, covered by green and ol´ rocks while the sun was almost gone. But everytime a host opened the door, it felt like home. Jeez.. How i miss salty irish butter and some fresh cones.

The only thing on the downside: It´s pricey. Don´t get me wrong, it´s nice and all and of course people need to live. But sometimes it was a bit outrageous here and there when it came to groceries or eating in pub/restaurant. Though on the upside the meals are very big i´ve to admit. But transport, fuel etc. is expensive. I paid for a 5min ferry ride like 20€. One way. The flight from germany though is a joke and.. I don´t know how to say it, but cmon. 60€ Two way ticket?! The filling of water of the toilets in the plane are even more expensive. I don´t wanna talk about economics (which i did in the middle of nowhere in a lonely rock desert in my favorite area ""Achill Islands"" with a stranger) but this cheap flying is curse and blessing big time. I talked with a shepherd about it and he said, a ride with the train from the Dingle Area to Dublin is more expensive. Freaky times.

All in all this road trip was one of my favorite trips so far and i just can recommend to everyone to go there while it´s off season and all the majority of tourists are gone. I had so many many places almost for me alone.. It felt like i´ve chosen the perfect time to go there. No super packed places, no queues, no overloaded roads.

As i mentioned it above, i do simple vlogs with an action cam, not money orientated, i make a living with a regular job like everyone else and just use it as a diary, while i travel most of the time alone and sometimes with my girlfriend. I still upload weekly storys since September from Ireland with all the people i met there and i invite you besides this ""little"" roman here to come over and have a watch while you´re at dinner or something. My favorite one so far is the experience with the lovely shepherd lady. [https://www.youtube.com/danabroad](https://www.youtube.com/danabroad)

Thanks a lot to the irish people for being so kind! This sounds very sentimental, but most of you please stay as you´re in a constantly changing world!

dairy AND price,9nc408,"Back from Ireland, and I miss it dearly.",ireland,145,0.93,"A buddy and I spent last week in the Republic of Ireland, and I've gotta say, I miss the hell out of this place.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always wanted to visit. 20 years ago, my parents went for 10 days and they had the time of their lives. Now that I am older and more financially responsible, I figured it was high time I went somewhere and experienced it all on my own terms. I had rented a car, set up hostels in various cities in advance, did my research, and felt confident that my buddy and I would have a good time. Little did we know just how incredible every aspect of Ireland truly is.

&amp;#x200B;

We caught separate flights from the states, but landed in Dublin Monday morning. After receiving our car, and quickly figuring out the differences between US driving and Ireland driving, we made our way to the city center. Naturally, everything seemed to astound us in the best of ways. It was all new; something we had never seen before. My buddy had been to other parts of Europe before, but this was my first time overseas. Driving through the streets and noticing the beautiful quirks really set the tone. Again, though, we had no freaking clue what was in store.

&amp;#x200B;

After checking into our hostel (Isaac's Hostel, 10/10 would recommend), we were in need of a pick-me-up, whether food or drink. Not knowing what was good or bad, we headed to JW Sweetman's and got a couple beers. Although nothing special at 10 am, it was very cozy, nevertheless. And the cheeky bartender was much appreciated. Trinity College was lovely to see on our stroll afterwards. As if we had simply woken up in an entirely new world, all we could really do was just take everything in and appreciate it for what it was worth. For our first stop in Ireland, Dublin treated us well.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that night, we were at a loss of what to do. However, we learned very quickly that if you ask a local for recommendations, they do not shy away. Granted, this was only our experience, but we met two 20-something guys who happily invited us to come to a club with them. That has never been a common occurrence back home. The dudes took us to Tramline, which was fucking goofy. The security did not put up with shit, so the poor dudes who took us there actually got kicked out of the line, however they let my buddy and I in. For not having a clue what we were getting into, Tramline turned up on a Monday night. Whoever those dudes were, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Next day we headed for Cork. Right off the bat, we were amazed that you can literally get a weeks-worth of groceries at a damn gas station. Wild. Also, unlike in the states, Irish gas station coffee is cheap af and relatively tasty. On the way to Cork, we made a few stops. We got to see Carlow Castle, which was my first castle, so I was very pleased. Next up was Kilkenny, a recommendation of my parents. It was well-worth the stop. I do not enjoy small towns in the states, for whatever reason, however, I fell in love with Kilkenny. I fell in love with all the towns we spent time in, frankly. Bollard's had great food and an excellent vibe, so that was a nice, quaint pub. The castle was also very beautiful, as was everything along the ""Medieval Mile."" Again, Kilkenny- I highly recommend.

&amp;#x200B;

One major cliche that people express when asked about trips to Ireland is that ""it is sooooo green."" I come from a place where the countryside is flat, desolate, and full of nothing but corn, so the vibrant greens were mesmerizing. And it proves that your country is really fucking green. I genuinely appreciated that. After seeing a few more castles, we had finally made our way to Cork.

&amp;#x200B;

Cork seemed a little sleepy the night we stayed (Tuesday). Despite this, the hospitality was superb. After checking into Bru Bar &amp; Hostel (Another great recommendation...the bartenders are dope), we headed out in search of a pub. We came across Sin e, which I've found out is highly recommended, despite us not knowing so beforehand. This was one of the coziest places I've been. You'll notice that a lot of the pubs we came across will be defined as ""cozy."" I'm a big soccer fan, so it was great to walk in and see the locals glued to a champions league game. After a pint, we headed for a place that I believe is called ""The Oval."" This place had a great vibe; I felt like I was wearing the darkest shades imaginable. Our night eventually ended up at Mutton Lane Inn, another sunglasses pub. One thing I noticed about the three pubs we had checked out in Cork is that they were all dark, and were mainly dimly lit by candlesticks. Nice touch, Cork.

&amp;#x200B;

Cork is a magnificent place, I'm sure. However, we spent less time there then we probably should have. Our night got a little weird; we met a girl from Australia who was staying at the same hostel as us, so we ended up hanging out with her that evening, eventually going back to our hostel's bar. After many drinks, drugs, meet and greets with local Irish and traveling Canadians, we headed for bed.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day (Wednesday) was a busy one, seeing as we had wanted to check out Blarney Castle, as well as drive the Ring of Kerry. I don't care what anyone might say, Blarney Castle was phenomenal. Both my buddy and I are really into history and architecture, so castles get us going. Blarney was no exception. Kissing the stone was a goofy plus to the overall experience, but to walk those grounds...absolutely beautiful. On our way to Kerry, we had stopped at another grocery store/gas station in Killarney. We could immediately tell that this town was sick. Wednesday night was a bit of a crapshoot, considering we didn't have a place to stay booked, so this town was a high contender. Also, we left Cork with more than what we came in with; the Australian girl decided to hitch a ride with us indefinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

We began the drive through Killarney National Park first, which was a great way to start the extensive drive. We were taken aback by how imposing the natural landscape was. It is a combination of things; first, you must consider your location, then you recognize the narrow, winding road you drive on, consisting of ballsy bus drivers who push the limits, and then you look out and see vast, mountainous countryside. The Ring of Kerry was gorgeous. Something about the combination of minimal people (October is a great time to avoid massive tourists), simple sheep and dairy farms, the scenic drive, and the Atlantic coast just made for an absolutely breathtaking experience.

&amp;#x200B;

We did end up staying at Neptunes Hostel in Killarney. It was a great price considering all that it consisted of. After an easy night of some grub and a couple drinks at random pubs, we went to bed. Thursday was to be a busy one, so it was a good call. We had planned to go to the Cliffs of Moher, and end up staying in Galway, a place we heard nothing but good things.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday was the coldest, as it was also the day with the most rain. However, this only made the Cliffs seem that much more spectacular, despite limiting some visibility. I had no idea that those things were 700+ feet. Wow. And again, we mustn't forget how green the pastures were. Damn. After arriving in Galway, and checking into Galway City Hostel (the best, hands down), we went out for food and drink. To be honest, I do not remember where we went...it turned out to be a great night. But I do know that we checked out An Pucan, which was delicious, and eventually ended up at a club that I thought was called Four Four, but I cannot seem to find anything that proves it exists...However, the bartender at An Pucan told us NOT to go to Electric, or DNA, so I assume wherever we were was the right place to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday morning was our day to check out Connemara. So, the three of our hungover selves set off. Little did we know just how incredible this drive was. I was floored. This was arguably my favorite day. I felt so small when driving through the mountains. I will never forget how majestic and beautiful it all was; so surreal. Later that night, we figured we should stay in Galway once more, on account of how much we liked it the first go-around. Instead of a hostel, we booked a room at the Jury Inn, which was convenient and comfortable, so we lucked out. It was also at the foot of all the action. Two Canadian dudes we had met and exchanged info with in Cork called us and happened to also be in Galway, so we met up for a night of debauchery. Yet again, my memory is hazy when it comes to remembering all where we went. But I do remember going to Kings Head, Tigh Neactain, and one pub that had multiple floors with smoking areas that had open roofs...wherever that was, some crazy shit went down. All in all, Galway was my favorite town during the entire trip.

&amp;#x200B;

We headed back to Dublin for our last night, which led us to more memorable drunken times, ultimately leading us to a very early Sunday morning, in which we were both very sad to leave. The Australian girl ended up journeying on in Dublin, and I'm sure she had one hell of a time. What I took away from this trip is that Ireland, which is smaller than the state I'm from, is one of the most geographically diverse countries I have ever seen, let alone, maybe one of the most geographically diverse in the world. Also, it must be said that the people of Ireland are absolutely beautiful, through and through. I could not believe the genuine hospitality that I was met with.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I want to say thank you. Thank you for allowing me to experience your beautiful homeland, and thank you for showing me such kindness. For what it's worth, I am counting down the days until I can come back. I did not get to see nearly enough, and I am beyond eager to experience even more. 6 days in your country was not enough. I would argue that a lifetime in your country may not be enough, but call me biased. I fell in love with Ireland, and I owe it to the land and all of its people. Thank you.

dairy AND subsidies,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.74,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

dairy AND fertilizer,xc90tp,New Policies By The Leprechaun Council Part 1,ireland,7,0.31,"Disclaimer: The following is a sarcastic take on the way people are getting fleeced in the country. The content of this article should not be taken as a professional recommendation by any unprofessional politicians who are running this place to the ground. If they do implement these as laws, please don't blame me... 


The grand council of Leprechauns has identified that the current issues faced by the people of Ireland stem from four main elements. 

1. A lack of housing 

2. The inflation in the market 

3. Lack of infrastructure (public transportation, energy production, schools , hospitals  , a functional airport or roads without potholes) 

4. Lack of money that is available to spend on the above. 

In order to combat these issues , we have devised a series of measures that should solve these problems. 

1.  A Graveyard Tax: 

It has come to our attention that alot of prime real estate is being taken up by the graves of people who are dead. Every individual is taking up a space of almost 20 square foot of space in a grave site. That's more space than a typical student accommodation! 

At this rate, we will have most of the land taken over by graveyards within a few centuries. So we hereby propose that every individual who wants to have a graveyard of the standard size , establish a trust fund that will pay a graveyard tax to the government in perpetuity. The fund needs to take into consideration the inflation trend and account for a 20% increase in estimated costs every year the graveyard will be occupied. Should your fund run out or you become delinquent in the payment, then the corpse will be exhumed and processed into bone meal for the gardens of the tech companies who are keeping the country afloat. 

For those who don't have the facility to pay said graveyard tax, you will have the option of a viking burial ( toss your corpse out on the ocean on a plyboard and light it up). This option will be subject to a carbon tax , depending on how much smoke you emit as your corpse burns. However, in the current market rend , we are sure you would have withered down to your bones due to the cost of living and hence your carbon tax would probably be covered by your pension fund. 

Another alternative for those who want to ensure their loved ones have a place to visit, is the tower of eternal slumber. This will be a multistory tower where each deceased individual will be intered in a block sized coffin and it will be arranged like Jenga blocks to ensure maximum space efficiencty. Our biggest sponsor , Demazon has offered to provide their expertise in warehouse management to help us build this structure. This however comes with a rental cost and if your loved ones are unable to pay the rent then your remains will become the property of Demazon to use as they see fit { Message from our sponsor: Demazon is now offering Fertilizer, pet food and calcium supplements at exciting prices }

If you have no money whatsoever and your loved ones are already burdened with the struggles of day to day living, then you have the exciting opportunity to volunteer yourself as a lab test subject to any of our pharmaceutical partners. This option will allow you to do your part for the future of humanity and the company would happily provide you with a vertical grave as a permanent resting place. Recent studies have shown the benefits of standing rather than sitting or sleeping. So these firms will offer you an ergonomically vertical graveyard after they have used your body for their nefarious purposes. 

2. Tax On Unauthorized Expulsion Of Gaseous Waste ( Fart /burp tax) 

Our minister for purple energy has identified that emissions of methane in all forms is a significant contributor to global warming. While the current measures are already working on taxing the farmers to their bones and making them take a shotgun to their cattle; we need to expand our carbon tax further. 

Henceforth, every individual would be expected to pay a fart tax along with their PRSI , USC , TV Tax, VAT  and the arbitrary taxes we come up with , promise to remove after a while but never do. The fart tax would be paid based on an estimated emission of fart based on your age , size , dietary pattern and dairy consumption. You will ofcourse have to do most of the work in calculating these and entering relevant information in our revenue website. At the end of the year, you will have to submit notarized affadavits to claim any fart free periods. When you purchase beans , dairy or other items that have been linked to causing said emissions, you will be taxed additionally at the checkout counter. Restaurants serving foods that cause flatulence will have the option of levying the tax on your bill. 

We will be conducting random assessment on your gaseous emission to ensure you are within your limits. An inspector will follow you around with a fart meter behind you and will give an assessment on your emmision level. 

Alternatively, you can install a smart fart meter on your rear that would directly link your emmision to our system. 


The tax will have provision to further expand into a breathing tax which is currently being researched. It has come to our attention that individuals who breathe are causing more expenses than those who don't for the government. Hence we will soon be expanding this tax to incentivize people to stop breathing. Remember,these taxes are a measure to incentivize positive behavior, not make money off you...

Girl told me no, they had a VAT increase recently and all prices went up and the milk went from 50cent to 1.20€. 

Checked back on my payments are last time we went (about 6 weeks ago) I paid 8.50 and now it’s 10.20. 

Told your one I thought 10.20 was scandalous for two coffees and she said that a few people had mentioned it, but didn’t want to start anything big with a minimum wage employee who has no control over prices. 

I work from home so tend to drink coffee at home during the week, so Saturday in town was probably the only one I’d get out and I enjoyed supporting a local business but fuck me there seems to be a right level of greed in some Irish business right now and charging 1.20 for a milk substitute for someone who actually needs it is terrible. 

Anyway sorry for the rant but I’m just sick of greedy businesses, because this place also stuck up all their prices when the levy on disposable cups came in regardless of if you had a keep cup or not.",2023-09-26,

We've read up on the visa/work/naturalization process and it seems fairly easy for us (coming from the U.S.A.) to move to Ireland. He has a wonderful career in clinical healthcare/healthcare administration, and I have experience in horticulture, teaching, and caregiving. Our expenses our low, the area we live in is safe, but the satisfaction of life leaves something to be desired. Currently we are apathetic to the U.S.A. at best and despise it at worst. It's not the kind of culture we would like to raise future children in (or live in ourselves.) We anticipate a move to a northern state in the U.S.A. (we live in the south) next year, but after that happens, we keep coming back to Ireland as a possibility. My great-great-grandparents came over to America from Ireland, but now I'd like to get the hell out. 

We are about 45% sure at this moment that we want to drop everything we know and start a dairy farm in Ireland. We only expect this percentage to increase as time goes on. We are not strangers to hard work, dirty work, or smelly work. We are very honest, kind, quiet people who keep to ourselves. We don't use drugs and have no criminal background. 

We have plans to WWOOF on a farm to see if the weather, climate, work, people etc agree with us.

2. What cities or locations would be best suited for us?

3. What sort of opportunities should we be on the lookout for? Maybe some hidden resources you know of online.

dairy AND ireland,gohbrl,Reform of Agriculture in Ireland,ireland,57,0.74,"I work with farmers throughout the country, and spend a lot of time in rural areas. I've been thinking for a while now that our agricultural system is completely unbalanced, almost entirely focussed on beef and dairy, with arable only in the south east, and sheep in the uplands / bogs.

I know that Ireland's climate is particularly well suited to grass, so we've focussed on that, and the export market. However, we're massively over-producing milk, and beef prices are very low, unprofitable without subsidies. Much of our dairy products are exported to the UK, but there is considerable uncertainty about that market, considering that they're trying to deregulate their domestic market. Our livestock are also producing massive greenhouse gas emissions. 

I think we need to diversify our agriculture again, by producing what we need here in Ireland, and focussing less on imports and exports. There are plenty of things that we can't grow in Ireland, or that are out of season, so of course they should be imported. However, if it can be grown here, then we should grow it. 

By the same logic, we should reduce our livestock sector to what is required for domestic consumption, and rely less on exports. That would allow us to reduce the national herd, and increase milk / beef prices to a level that is profitable for farmers.

People will say that Irish conditions are too wet for most arable agriculture. However, the country once supported a much larger population, and produced enough food for everyone without relying on imports. That was also achieved without the machinery, drainage, fertilisers and pesticides that we use now. So there is no doubt that much of our pastureland could be converted to other forms of agriculture.",2020-05-22,

dairy AND ireland,9nc408,"Back from Ireland, and I miss it dearly.",ireland,145,0.93,"A buddy and I spent last week in the Republic of Ireland, and I've gotta say, I miss the hell out of this place.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always wanted to visit. 20 years ago, my parents went for 10 days and they had the time of their lives. Now that I am older and more financially responsible, I figured it was high time I went somewhere and experienced it all on my own terms. I had rented a car, set up hostels in various cities in advance, did my research, and felt confident that my buddy and I would have a good time. Little did we know just how incredible every aspect of Ireland truly is.

&amp;#x200B;

We caught separate flights from the states, but landed in Dublin Monday morning. After receiving our car, and quickly figuring out the differences between US driving and Ireland driving, we made our way to the city center. Naturally, everything seemed to astound us in the best of ways. It was all new; something we had never seen before. My buddy had been to other parts of Europe before, but this was my first time overseas. Driving through the streets and noticing the beautiful quirks really set the tone. Again, though, we had no freaking clue what was in store.

&amp;#x200B;

After checking into our hostel (Isaac's Hostel, 10/10 would recommend), we were in need of a pick-me-up, whether food or drink. Not knowing what was good or bad, we headed to JW Sweetman's and got a couple beers. Although nothing special at 10 am, it was very cozy, nevertheless. And the cheeky bartender was much appreciated. Trinity College was lovely to see on our stroll afterwards. As if we had simply woken up in an entirely new world, all we could really do was just take everything in and appreciate it for what it was worth. For our first stop in Ireland, Dublin treated us well.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that night, we were at a loss of what to do. However, we learned very quickly that if you ask a local for recommendations, they do not shy away. Granted, this was only our experience, but we met two 20-something guys who happily invited us to come to a club with them. That has never been a common occurrence back home. The dudes took us to Tramline, which was fucking goofy. The security did not put up with shit, so the poor dudes who took us there actually got kicked out of the line, however they let my buddy and I in. For not having a clue what we were getting into, Tramline turned up on a Monday night. Whoever those dudes were, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Next day we headed for Cork. Right off the bat, we were amazed that you can literally get a weeks-worth of groceries at a damn gas station. Wild. Also, unlike in the states, Irish gas station coffee is cheap af and relatively tasty. On the way to Cork, we made a few stops. We got to see Carlow Castle, which was my first castle, so I was very pleased. Next up was Kilkenny, a recommendation of my parents. It was well-worth the stop. I do not enjoy small towns in the states, for whatever reason, however, I fell in love with Kilkenny. I fell in love with all the towns we spent time in, frankly. Bollard's had great food and an excellent vibe, so that was a nice, quaint pub. The castle was also very beautiful, as was everything along the ""Medieval Mile."" Again, Kilkenny- I highly recommend.

&amp;#x200B;

One major cliche that people express when asked about trips to Ireland is that ""it is sooooo green."" I come from a place where the countryside is flat, desolate, and full of nothing but corn, so the vibrant greens were mesmerizing. And it proves that your country is really fucking green. I genuinely appreciated that. After seeing a few more castles, we had finally made our way to Cork.

&amp;#x200B;

Cork seemed a little sleepy the night we stayed (Tuesday). Despite this, the hospitality was superb. After checking into Bru Bar &amp; Hostel (Another great recommendation...the bartenders are dope), we headed out in search of a pub. We came across Sin e, which I've found out is highly recommended, despite us not knowing so beforehand. This was one of the coziest places I've been. You'll notice that a lot of the pubs we came across will be defined as ""cozy."" I'm a big soccer fan, so it was great to walk in and see the locals glued to a champions league game. After a pint, we headed for a place that I believe is called ""The Oval."" This place had a great vibe; I felt like I was wearing the darkest shades imaginable. Our night eventually ended up at Mutton Lane Inn, another sunglasses pub. One thing I noticed about the three pubs we had checked out in Cork is that they were all dark, and were mainly dimly lit by candlesticks. Nice touch, Cork.

&amp;#x200B;

Cork is a magnificent place, I'm sure. However, we spent less time there then we probably should have. Our night got a little weird; we met a girl from Australia who was staying at the same hostel as us, so we ended up hanging out with her that evening, eventually going back to our hostel's bar. After many drinks, drugs, meet and greets with local Irish and traveling Canadians, we headed for bed.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day (Wednesday) was a busy one, seeing as we had wanted to check out Blarney Castle, as well as drive the Ring of Kerry. I don't care what anyone might say, Blarney Castle was phenomenal. Both my buddy and I are really into history and architecture, so castles get us going. Blarney was no exception. Kissing the stone was a goofy plus to the overall experience, but to walk those grounds...absolutely beautiful. On our way to Kerry, we had stopped at another grocery store/gas station in Killarney. We could immediately tell that this town was sick. Wednesday night was a bit of a crapshoot, considering we didn't have a place to stay booked, so this town was a high contender. Also, we left Cork with more than what we came in with; the Australian girl decided to hitch a ride with us indefinitely.

&amp;#x200B;

We began the drive through Killarney National Park first, which was a great way to start the extensive drive. We were taken aback by how imposing the natural landscape was. It is a combination of things; first, you must consider your location, then you recognize the narrow, winding road you drive on, consisting of ballsy bus drivers who push the limits, and then you look out and see vast, mountainous countryside. The Ring of Kerry was gorgeous. Something about the combination of minimal people (October is a great time to avoid massive tourists), simple sheep and dairy farms, the scenic drive, and the Atlantic coast just made for an absolutely breathtaking experience.

&amp;#x200B;

We did end up staying at Neptunes Hostel in Killarney. It was a great price considering all that it consisted of. After an easy night of some grub and a couple drinks at random pubs, we went to bed. Thursday was to be a busy one, so it was a good call. We had planned to go to the Cliffs of Moher, and end up staying in Galway, a place we heard nothing but good things.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday was the coldest, as it was also the day with the most rain. However, this only made the Cliffs seem that much more spectacular, despite limiting some visibility. I had no idea that those things were 700+ feet. Wow. And again, we mustn't forget how green the pastures were. Damn. After arriving in Galway, and checking into Galway City Hostel (the best, hands down), we went out for food and drink. To be honest, I do not remember where we went...it turned out to be a great night. But I do know that we checked out An Pucan, which was delicious, and eventually ended up at a club that I thought was called Four Four, but I cannot seem to find anything that proves it exists...However, the bartender at An Pucan told us NOT to go to Electric, or DNA, so I assume wherever we were was the right place to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday morning was our day to check out Connemara. So, the three of our hungover selves set off. Little did we know just how incredible this drive was. I was floored. This was arguably my favorite day. I felt so small when driving through the mountains. I will never forget how majestic and beautiful it all was; so surreal. Later that night, we figured we should stay in Galway once more, on account of how much we liked it the first go-around. Instead of a hostel, we booked a room at the Jury Inn, which was convenient and comfortable, so we lucked out. It was also at the foot of all the action. Two Canadian dudes we had met and exchanged info with in Cork called us and happened to also be in Galway, so we met up for a night of debauchery. Yet again, my memory is hazy when it comes to remembering all where we went. But I do remember going to Kings Head, Tigh Neactain, and one pub that had multiple floors with smoking areas that had open roofs...wherever that was, some crazy shit went down. All in all, Galway was my favorite town during the entire trip.

&amp;#x200B;

We headed back to Dublin for our last night, which led us to more memorable drunken times, ultimately leading us to a very early Sunday morning, in which we were both very sad to leave. The Australian girl ended up journeying on in Dublin, and I'm sure she had one hell of a time. What I took away from this trip is that Ireland, which is smaller than the state I'm from, is one of the most geographically diverse countries I have ever seen, let alone, maybe one of the most geographically diverse in the world. Also, it must be said that the people of Ireland are absolutely beautiful, through and through. I could not believe the genuine hospitality that I was met with.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I want to say thank you. Thank you for allowing me to experience your beautiful homeland, and thank you for showing me such kindness. For what it's worth, I am counting down the days until I can come back. I did not get to see nearly enough, and I am beyond eager to experience even more. 6 days in your country was not enough. I would argue that a lifetime in your country may not be enough, but call me biased. I fell in love with Ireland, and I owe it to the land and all of its people. Thank you.

dairy AND ireland,23uln2,One Year a Paddy: Reflections on Ireland from a Yank,ireland,151,0.86,"I moved from the USA to Ireland a little over a year ago and wanted to post some of my thoughts about the island.

* When I first moved over, I didn't know what to expect.  My family's not Irish, so I had no preconceived notions of hunting down long lost relatives or visiting a small ancestral cottage in Kerry.  I've found when I tell people I'm not of Irish descent, they almost always like me right away.    I guess this speaks to just how annoying many tourists must be.

* On that topic I have, surprisingly, had many people tell me about their family that moved to America, and got to experience just how boring it is hearing someone else's family history.

* The variation in accents is fascinating to me.  How could such a small place have such different ways of talking?  Whenever I would meet someone who's accent I hadn't heard before, say Cork or Carlow, I would always be dumbfounded and find them incomprehensible.

* A lot of people ask me if Irish people are really as big into drinking as the stereotype suggests.  The thing is that if you don't go to the pub, at least every once and a while, people will consider you weird.  I've always liked going out to drink, and don't find that people drink more necessarily, but that it's social protocol to go out to the pub.

* On that note, Guinness really is much different here than it is in the US.  I would rarely drink it before I moved here, but now won't drink anything else.

* The amount of litter is always amazing to me.  I understand that on a Saturday morning the sidewalk around a chipper is going to be a mess, but it goes beyond that.  People will throw trash anywhere.  The state of rivers in even a small town is evidence of how little people seem to care about making an otherwise picturesque place look like garbage.

* The meats and dairy products, specifically lamb, are something to be proud of.   I can't tell you how nice it is compared to what we have in America.  Milk too, and I come from a state that people brag about their milk.  I know it's getting better, but I've always found the dairy aisles funny for the sheer amount of cheddar and no other type of cheese.  I remember telling friends, ""You guys know  there's more than one type of cheese, right?""

* The people are great.  75% of them, anyways.  They'll take time out of their day to show you how to get somewhere and then say you should come by for tea.  Irish moms are the best.  When I first moved over I wondered why people honked so much, assuming people were very angry drivers.  It took me a while to figure out they were saying hello to a friend walking down the street.  25% of the people, though, are just gigantic assholes that wouldn't spit on you to put out a fire because they don't like your face and when they get drunk...

* Everyone knows EVERYONE.  I can't tell you how many times I've overheard two strangers have this conversation in a pub: ""Oh sure, your mom is my neighbor's cousin's barber.  Sure, I know about you.""

* There's something I have started to call ""Irish Time.""  Someone says meet you at 9 it means 9:15, someone tells you a couple of days it means a week, you need paperwork from the government and they say it will take a month or two then may God have mercy on your soul.

* The price of some things are astounding.  Car insurance is how much?  You have to pay to HAVE a TV?  I couldn't believe it.  Never take for granted, though, how great it is to only have to pay 50 euro to see a doctor without insurance.

* Hatred towards Travellers is shocking to me.  I know it's a controversial subject, but to me, it's embarrassing for all parties involved.

* Before I moved to Ireland I could count the number of times I went to church on my fingers.  Since moving here I've been to mass six or seven times, and I'm not even Catholic.   

* I think a lot of Irish people like to talk bad about their country.  They don't like it an want to move to Australia as soon as they get a chance.  They think that if you don't live in Dublin that life will be a nightmare.  I personally think that there is so much to be proud of.  It is a truly unique country with some of the best people you'd ever like to meet.",2014-04-24,

Our climate and relative lack of population density means that our cattle and sheep are out grazing in the greenest of grass for most of the year, but in most places, industrial farming puts animals indoors being fed processed leftover byproducts as much as anything else and christ you taste the difference.

So yeah, nothing massive, just be a little thankful that nobody ever talks about grass fed beef on our little isle because the most efficient way for us to produce meat also means they're not trapped in massive industrial sheds all day long, pumped full of whatever maximises the speed of journey from birth to plate.

dairy AND ireland,yioxfk,Is it truly unaffordable for lower-income families to eat healthi?,ireland,167,0.67,"Very often I read that obesity is rife among low-income families because they can’t afford to buy fresh, good-quality ingredients and thus resort to ‘top-shelf products’ like pot noodles, which are €1 each. I’m slightly sceptical of this view. One of my favourite meals is courgettes &amp; bacon with spaghetti. When I add up how much this costs for 4 people this is how it works out: €1.19 for two courgettes (500g), 125g bacon (€1), onion (25c), olive oil (10c from big bottle), 400g spaghetti (€1.50), 4 eggs (€1.20) and some Parmesan (30c from packet). So this amounts to €5.50 overall or €1.40 per person for a family of 4 -  not much more than the €1 pot noodles but much more nutritious and filling. And not particularly time-consuming.

There are so many other meals that can be made cheaply on a strict budget - videos on Youtube show how to make things like curry for under $10 for example (these videos are mainly produced by Americans but use ingredients widely available in Ireland). 

This all leads me to believe that ignorance/lack of time/laziness are more to blame for obesity than lack of money. I don’t think ‘inability to cook’ is really an excuse - basically anyone can learn how to cook a decent meal from YouTube tutorials or from other sources online. Furthermore, the quality of produce in Ireland is second to none (consider the dairy and meat for example), so if people do decide to cook their own meals they’ll be highly nutritious (unlike in the US where he quality of meat an be poor).

I feel like I shouldn't eat anything I wouldn't be willing to kill myself. Even if I don't raise chickens myself I doubt I'd have any concerns lobing the head off a chicken place in front of me. 

Killing fish doesn't bother me in the slightest, I just want it to be from sustainable fishing.

But fish is pretty expensive and it's tough to source decent fish in London (where I am for the year) so I mostly eat chicken and vegetarian stuff. 

Anyone else have a diet similar to mine? 

What I'm trying to parse out for myself is how I feel about the dairy industry, My mothers family has a dairy farm and it's never struck me as the slightest bit cruel, the cows are all treated very well when they're on the farm but then again inevitably male calves are sold for veal or to the beef industry and cows are sent to slaughter once they stop producing milk... so I'm fairly stuck on it tbh, I don't like the meat industry at all really, don't mind the dairy industry, but I don't like the connections the dairy industry has to the meat industry.

I've never been a dairy fiend either, I don't drink milk but I do eat the odd bit of cheese or butter or cream once a week probably, I don't avoid it, that's just how my diet naturally is so it really wouldn't be much effort to cut out dairy, but like I said I'm not sure if there is any point really.

dairy AND ireland,ep8f7i,2000 Kilometers around Ireland - A great journey &amp; my thoughts,ireland,22,0.89,"Dear irish people and ireland lovers,

in September 2019 i sat myself in the plane to Dublin, rented a car and started to explore the island for 7 days without pretty much research about famous sights and things. This might be sound strange in the 21st century with Phones´n Apps´n Net, but it´s way more fun to figure out what people and locals tell you on the road.. or sometimes unfortunately not. Of course, completly without phone is unconvenient. Especially with maps, airbnb and food spots. But making plans on the road works pretty fine for me for some years already and meeting and hanging out with local people is the best.

The trip started immediately incredibly good.. Jeez, irish people are so welcoming, heartwarming and nice, that i felt very cozy on that small and sometimes creepy roads and cottages. I thought, it might be war on those tiny roads, but they´re all so polite drivers and i swear, in 2k Kilometers i only freaked out 1 or 2 times, while furious road rage and shouting at people is a speciality in germany, where i´m from, btw. Almost everyone is greeting or waving at you (in a friendly way) and if there´s a question about anything, well.. Don´t dare to ask. It seemed like i found the goldpot on the end of the rainbow before i even slid it down and high fived the goblin... Already on day No.1!

I met incredibly nice characters, of all facettes and ages that i´m feeling like a fanboy telling all my friends that i was in ireland and compare each country now with ireland like i´m Howard Wollowitz who came lately from space. There was Phil the dairy farmer or Brigid the shepherd.. and so many more. Those 7 days was actually a constant hussle. Everyday booking and finding a new airbnb (which wasn´t that cheap btw), doing the new route, recording vlogs.. But it doesn´t felt like it was stressful. I enjoyed almost every minute with all the people i met and the perfect nature i saw. For sure, i´m very focused on meeting people and wanna see how they live and learn about their culture. That´s why i drove 95% countryroads, visiting each little village where sometimes the center was only one house with some dogs. But it´s time consuming. For 250Km way by car, you´re on the track for 3-4h. And this brings me to the most important point: Time management. I think i did the best with the time i had. In 7 days i had like 2 very rainy and one slight rainy day. The 2 bad ones i used to stick more on the road and approach the west of the island earlier (which was a very nice move, turned out later) and that other day i was really mad, because it destroyed my experience in Galway, which i skipped after being bloody wet. But all in all i was lucky and got accostumed to wind and quick weather changes pretty fast. Sometimes i still have this fine sea breeze in my nose.. Which i like so damn much. Anyway. The car gives such an huge advantage, especially when it comes to the airbnbs, which was -in my case- everytime located in the deepest countryside and yes.. The first and second approach to my cozy beds led me through mysterious and ancient roads, covered by green and ol´ rocks while the sun was almost gone. But everytime a host opened the door, it felt like home. Jeez.. How i miss salty irish butter and some fresh cones.

The only thing on the downside: It´s pricey. Don´t get me wrong, it´s nice and all and of course people need to live. But sometimes it was a bit outrageous here and there when it came to groceries or eating in pub/restaurant. Though on the upside the meals are very big i´ve to admit. But transport, fuel etc. is expensive. I paid for a 5min ferry ride like 20€. One way. The flight from germany though is a joke and.. I don´t know how to say it, but cmon. 60€ Two way ticket?! The filling of water of the toilets in the plane are even more expensive. I don´t wanna talk about economics (which i did in the middle of nowhere in a lonely rock desert in my favorite area ""Achill Islands"" with a stranger) but this cheap flying is curse and blessing big time. I talked with a shepherd about it and he said, a ride with the train from the Dingle Area to Dublin is more expensive. Freaky times.

All in all this road trip was one of my favorite trips so far and i just can recommend to everyone to go there while it´s off season and all the majority of tourists are gone. I had so many many places almost for me alone.. It felt like i´ve chosen the perfect time to go there. No super packed places, no queues, no overloaded roads.

As i mentioned it above, i do simple vlogs with an action cam, not money orientated, i make a living with a regular job like everyone else and just use it as a diary, while i travel most of the time alone and sometimes with my girlfriend. I still upload weekly storys since September from Ireland with all the people i met there and i invite you besides this ""little"" roman here to come over and have a watch while you´re at dinner or something. My favorite one so far is the experience with the lovely shepherd lady. [https://www.youtube.com/danabroad](https://www.youtube.com/danabroad)

Thanks a lot to the irish people for being so kind! This sounds very sentimental, but most of you please stay as you´re in a constantly changing world!

dairy AND ireland,17oupud,Animals cruelty,ireland,139,0.94,"Sorry if this is incoherent but I am extremely mad and upset. Also can't sleep

So Today around 7pm 2 greyhounds were set on my cat and they absolutely destroyed her. She is in the emergency vets and will lucky to make it through the night. Horrific injuries. I couldn't even look at the cat and had to get my partner to get her into a box to bring to the vets.

What sickens me is the owner was watching as this is happening. I live in a housing estate. It's not a nice one. Beggers can't be chosers though. 
The greyhounds owner did nothing he just watched as my mother ran out of the house screaming at him and trying to get him to do something. She tried to get the cat off the dogs. One of them wouldn't let the cat go. My mother then asked him what his name and he said ""none of your buisness"" and walked off which makes me believe it was a blooding attack. Its a serious problem where I live as there is a feild next to the estate and you see young lads with greyhounds always ""racing"" out there. 

Look if it was a accident and he said he was sorry he should have dog on lead I wouldnt have been so mad. Im a resonable person most of the time. The fact that he was aggressive towards my mother and rude about the whole thing is what is really upsetting me. I don't have the words to describe how messed up that is. My mother said he is gonna be a sorry boy if the cat doesnt make.it and is responsible for vet bills. She said all this in the moment. Look...Dogs chase cats it's fact. But people have to be responsible and have them on a lead in public or muzzled if needs be. This was right outside my front door. My poor cat not safe in my own garden.

This is not the first time this has happened around me. Cats are disappearing around the estate and I dont know what to do or who to report to. Dog warden does be up but nothing is done. 
Guards are no help.

I can't sleep as I'm worried about my pet. I had her all her life. She was born in my back garden.

I was researching about greyhounds and the laws with dogs off leads and whatever else and came across blood sports. 

Like how barbaric is this country to treat animals this way. You just have to scroll through Facebook and you come videos of people releasing hares or cats to be horribly killed or injured by dogs. Hare coarsing is legal. How is the torture of animals as entertainment legal?

Sorry I'm ranting but I'm so enraged and sad. I want to do something but I don't know what or where to start. You shouldn't have to worry letting your pet out of the house in fear of this happening.
I also have another cat and if nothing is done terrified she will meet the same fate.

Anyone have ideas or resources for me. Based in offaly if it helps.

Update:
Dog Warden and Guardi were called.


Another update: Unfortunately injures were too severe. She has passed to the rainbow Bridge.

dairy AND common agricultural policy,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.76," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

My wife and I run a 125-ish head goat dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada, and turn all of the milk into a variety of cheeses.  Due to ever increasing grain prices in recent years (up ~ 40% over the last 5 years), we've been pondering taking the dairy purely grass based (there are other reasons for this, but cost is a big one for us).  The area we're in is fairly good for forage production, and depending on the year, we can frequently pasture between late March/early April and mid-to-late October.  Granted, the early fall grasses aren't as good as that spring flush, but animals definitely prefer it to hay, and we like the characteristics grazing and browsing gives to the milk, and in turn to our cheeses.

Were we to drastically cut back on grain, what should I be looking at doing to help keep the milk solids (ie. fat and protein) as high as possible, which would give us the best cheese yields?  ",2016-02-02,

I'm trying to get a better grasp on some of the changes in the farming industry that are affecting how you operate and will be important in the near future.

Some big ones i've seen in the region i work in:

1. more erratic weather patterns: on the crop production side, more rain overall and extreme precipitation earlier and more drought conditions later.
2. the intensification of the issues of low dairy prices: milk processors failing and merging, the supply not really changing because smaller herds are absorbed by bigger producers, less milk in schools, ect.
3. Trade/geopolitical uncertainty on regional soybean exports: prices were already dropping from post great-recession levels. A good portion barely broke even last year.

First of all I'd like to say I'm not a farmer, far from it, I'm a software developer. Never the less I have huge respect for what all of you do. I, probably like a lot of people am becoming increasingly frustrated with the quality and price of supermarkets. Now I know they are not going to go away, but what I was wondering is if there could be an realistic 'direct from farm' alternative. I've noticed and embraced the local farms near to where I live have started to offer parts of this, for example a local dairy farm now has a milk vending machine where you can buy fresh pasteurised whole milk. Another was offering BBQ boxes in the summer with a selection of cuts great for the grill. Which is amazing, I've loved having that available to me. But it doesn't quite do enough to mean I don't have to trawl round Tesco once a week, trying to figure out why my tomatoes have more airmiles than I do this year.  
If there was something like Amazon for local fresh produce direct from the farm then I would be a very loyal customer, and I'm absolutely certain others would too. As much as it's great to go to the farm to buy a BBQ box once a month, it just doesnt quite have the convenience that means it fits into day to day life. Although I have a one year old so day to day life for me is trying to get to bedtime without having to go to A&amp;E, so I'm probably a bad example.  
I guess my question to your community, is how feasible is it for you to go direct to consumers, what would prevent you from listing your produce on an online marketplace and would you even want to in the first place?  
I really am of the opinion it would be something the public would want, but I absolutely understand with every other pressure you guys are under at the moment that it would have to seamlessly integrate with your business.

I spent many years as a winemakers apprentice. And for those in the know all a winemaker is, is a glorified grape farmer. I know my way around a tractor, making things grow, and working grueling long days on a farm.

But the lady and I had our offer accepted on a large house on 10.5 acres. There is a large barn on the property, that is two stories, as in the not too distant past, it was a dairy farm. The old owners are going to be taking out the cow stalls and clearing out the barn before we move in.  The lady wants horses and part of the barn will be a stable.

I dont have a lot of experience in the cost of things, as I used my old boss' equipment, and there was a lot I did that was probably different than other farms, or might be specific to that vineyard I worked on. I apologize for the long post, I am just the type of person who likes as much detail as possible.

So, the property is in South/Central NY, near the PA border. So I know my first priority is a tractor. Based on my research it seems as though I may need 35-45 HP for my type of property. I will mostly be using it to mow, and plow, and till, as well as everything else that comes with a farm with horses.

I will have a plot of land set aside for growing crops. Nothing big, just enough for my family and I, and canning surplus. And Ill need it to haul around loads of stuff like manure, and feed, etc.

SO...what are some affordable, but dependable makers for tractors that I may need? Price range for tractors in my range, used? new? I plan to do the maintenance and wrenching myself.

affordable but dependable 3 hitch attachments for the things I may need?

There are so many brand names, and I dont know what reasonable prices are.

On the farm side, I guess, what do you do with all that, well...shit? I dont want to just spread it all the time across the property, and just smell horse shit all day.

I was thinking maybe pouring a cement slab, and creating a composting pile for all the poop. Is this reasonable? Or should I bury it? How far away should anything poop related be, from the house to avoid smell?

Mowing...When I was on the vineyard, when I mowed, my boss had me just let it lie, where it was cut. Is this what is supposed to be done, on large property? How about near the house itself? Do I get a rake attachment for the tractor? what do you do with all that grass?

Hay...have no experience with it. Any info is appreciated.

I am considering a job with a startup and would love your feedback on how big of a problem this is as I have little-to-no experience in the sector (and would be working in accounting, but want to make sure it's a good sector).

The startup has designed a system to detect and monitor a cow's health. They're trying to solve for the issue of cows getting infections (mastitis) and making it easier for farmers to monitor their cows health at a lower price. They mentioned it typically costing around $400 per cow and hard to identify which cow is actually sick.

If there as a solution that helped you monitor your cows health in real-time, is this interesting you? Has it already been solved by other companies? Your feedback will help me understand the potential market for this type of problem.

Thank you,

dairy AND price,h9m9dw,I'm hoping for input on a discussion re: small scale livestock.,farming,19,1.0,"First off, I love this subreddit, you guys are awesome! 

So we are just getting started on farming/homesteading. We have just over thirty acres, one Jersey heifer, some laying chickens and some meat birds ~150 birds all together, we have three feeder pigs arriving this week. 

The discussion is regarding cows/cattle. Millie, our little heifer is lonely and we want to get her some companions. I found an elderly Jersey cow (13) with two calves on her for $2500. One of the calves is A2/A2 and the other is an adopted red Angus/jerseyx. I think they would be a great addition and I think it's a reasonable price. I figure we can breed our heifer Millie this season, breed the older cow this season, breed the A2/A2 calf and Millie next year and slaughter the angusx next year. Any calves we produce we can either sell or eat depending on sex. Having multiple milk cows is insurance that we will always be in milk. I also think getting an older, proven cow will be a better teaching tool for me as Millie is totally untrained and pretty skiddish. I'm hoping a more mature cow around will put her (and me) at ease. I see purchasing these as an investment that will give us returns. They have however been up for sale for a long time so maybe there is something I'm missing. Maybe introducing a cow with calves to a lone heifer is not the best way to install a herd...

My husband is leaning more towards purchasing steers. He thinks we can get a yearling to slaughter in the fall and a weaner to carry through winter to keep Millie company until she calves. We are in an area with a lot of Angus cattle, I think trying to sell the meat will be a lot harder and that'll be too much meat for our family. But maybe I'm looking at it all wrong. Maybe doubling down on cows is unwise. Maybe there's a reason there's so many cattle farmers around here and selling an A2A2 Jersey will be hard.

dairy AND price,1pf874,Should subsidies be removed?,farming,27,0.87,"As someone who lives among farmers and grew up on one, I've always wondered if farmers and society in general can work better without too much interference from the government.

I've also read about how New Zealand have completely removed subsidies, tax concessions and price supports and yet have a very healthy and strong agricultural sector, making up the largest sector of the tradable economy, contributing about two-thirds of New Zealand's exports.

I've also read about how subsidies keep poor countries from developing their agricultural sector, and how we can help them improve and even remove hunger by making them able to produce and sell their food on the market. In other words, if we buy their food instead of keeping them out and only buy food made by our own farmers, we can help them grow in knowledge and self sufficiency.

Now I've talked to a lot of farmers, and some of them are for this, while most of them are for the current situation, where at least for my country, the subsidies make up for about 50-60% of income and theres heavy tolls and import barriers on food from other countries. The government currently makes a lot of the decisions on food production.

dairy AND price,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.73," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

I am in favor of the program due to the research paid for by the program for corn.  Ethanol became much more affordable due to the research funded with checkoff dollars.  The political lobbying that got ethanol quotas was also funded by Checkoff.

With the success, I'm surprised that other industries haven't tried it.  Unions are similar but not really.  Imagine if all computer sales had to put 1% into the IEEE to fund research for future development.

Or 1% of healthcare costs when to a fund to educate consumers.

I've also read about how New Zealand have completely removed subsidies, tax concessions and price supports and yet have a very healthy and strong agricultural sector, making up the largest sector of the tradable economy, contributing about two-thirds of New Zealand's exports.

I've also read about how subsidies keep poor countries from developing their agricultural sector, and how we can help them improve and even remove hunger by making them able to produce and sell their food on the market. In other words, if we buy their food instead of keeping them out and only buy food made by our own farmers, we can help them grow in knowledge and self sufficiency.

Now I've talked to a lot of farmers, and some of them are for this, while most of them are for the current situation, where at least for my country, the subsidies make up for about 50-60% of income and theres heavy tolls and import barriers on food from other countries.

dairy AND subsidies,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.77," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

My wife and I run a 125-ish head goat dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada, and turn all of the milk into a variety of cheeses.  Due to ever increasing grain prices in recent years (up ~ 40% over the last 5 years), we've been pondering taking the dairy purely grass based (there are other reasons for this, but cost is a big one for us).  The area we're in is fairly good for forage production, and depending on the year, we can frequently pasture between late March/early April and mid-to-late October.  Granted, the early fall grasses aren't as good as that spring flush, but animals definitely prefer it to hay, and we like the characteristics grazing and browsing gives to the milk, and in turn to our cheeses.

Were we to drastically cut back on grain, what should I be looking at doing to help keep the milk solids (ie. fat and protein) as high as possible, which would give us the best cheese yields?  ",2016-02-02,
dairy AND yield,1576595,How many different hybrids/seed types do you tend to use?,farming,15,1.0,"Hi all,

I’m just curious how many different types of seed do you typically run in a given year for each crop? Obviously different strains will do better in different soil types but do you stick with just 1 or 2 you’ve had good luck with? Do you try a bunch of different seeds at once in a test plot? Or do you run a multitude in different fields to try to cover yourself in case a couple don’t produce well? 

My area is mostly made up of smaller dairy farms and orchards. The only field crop that gets grown in any real quantity is corn. It seems that most of the locals stick with either 1 or 2 varieties though I’ll occasionally see a plot where someone appears to be testing different strains/spacing out.

If you do run a variety of types in a given year how complicated does it make your life? Do you find yourself having to treat each field differently during the growing season/at harvest or does everything kind of just flow as normal and you just tally up yields at the end of the year?",2023-07-23,
dairy AND yield,kgcyqf,Trying to dial in the herd...,farming,8,0.81,"Hey, so I’m trying to start managing the dairy herd on the farm as I will own this herd in a few years. I’m trying to work with our nutrition management guy to get our grain and feed rations correct but the current owner of the farm has never tracked total milk yields per cow or anything in that vein.

We do have a milk meter so that we can weigh our milk yields from the cows, but I need help with the best way of tracking and calculating peak yields and such. 

Does anyone have some sort of spreadsheet with formulas or anything that they’d be willing to share? Or even just any insight. Thanks!",2020-12-19,
dairy AND yield,ryo500,I was wondering if any of you have positive (or negative) experiences with some artisanal-scale projects to create foodstuffs from your own farming yields.,farming,16,0.67,"**Question**: What are some nice products or byproducts like (honey, olive oil, cheese, ...) that can be created as a sort of value-adding hobby (passion project) to farm yields that can be farmed on a 7-11ha plot of land? Preferably limiting the investment in very specific more expensive equipment. 

**Context**: My family is looking into buying a smallish (7-11ha) plot of land in the lower half of Portugal. (my mother really wants to move there to slow down and ease into retirement.) She would like to rent out a vacation home. My dad wants a farm-related hobby-ish project.

My mother has this idea rather developed and stable on her end. My father however ... errr, is ambitous? In his typical manner, he is all over the place. 

The goal is to create a permaculture ""farm"", or at least try. Thus some animals will be kept on a couple of ha. Most likely there will be a sizeable olive plantation too. It's not likely feasible or desirable to try any wholesale/industrial farming efforts. Yet we'll have to do some things with a decent portion of the land for maintenance either way.

My father, the enthusiastic culinary soul, hopes to do something like a community project. We don't have the kind of capital for larger projects, that just cost money.

So to avoid traps and/or disappointment I was wondering if any of you have positive (or negative) experiences with some artisanal-scale projects to create foodstuffs from your own farming yields. 

(Some investment is not a problem, especially if it would likely be a break-even or moderately profitable in the end.)",2022-01-08,
dairy AND yield,gqhrl1,How to bridge the gap between environmentalists and farmers?,farming,36,0.91,"Okay, I know this is a sensitive topic, but it's one I'm super interested in. Sorry if this is too long. 

I grew up in a rural community in Northwestern PA on a small farm- horses and blueberries for the local area. I was surrounded by small farms of all sorts- beef, dairy, wool, hay, and grains of all sorts. I then went to school for environmental science and moved to a larger city- Pittsburgh.

Over my years, I've definitely noticed a disconnect between environmental concern and how farming is actually done. Stuff like seed patents and GMOs are non-issue for farmers, but environmentalists still are concerned about them. 

I've taken an eco-pragmatist/Bright Green approach to environmentalism. I'm all for better tech like GMOs, better and safer pesticides that are more targeted, higher yields, better application technology for fertilizers. This is the kind of stuff I see some of my fellow environmentalists either not liking or understanding, as some would rather see the return to small farms for everyone- but I believe that would be a disaster for land use, which is a main concern of mine due to biodiversity loss. 

What do you think it would take to bridge the gap between environmentalists and farmers? I rather make bonds between the two groups so that effective policy and regulations can be create and the two sides understand each other better. 

Also, another question- I know area of contention is meat production. I've been seeing a lot about meat production due antibiotic resistance/SARS-COV-2, greenhouse gasses, land use, and water pollution. I'm no vegetarian, and I think the ""you can't be an environmentalist and eat meat"" message is gatekeeping and harmful for the environmental as a whole. 

I will say these are concerning to me though from my understanding water pollution is a rather small problem from large, well-regulated farms, and a lot of this from fertilizer run off instead. I'm really most concerned about greenhouse gasses and land use, with anti-biotic resistance staying on my radar. Are these things to be concerned about? And what role do you think meat replacements- veg-meat and lab-grown meat- will play in the future due to these concerns?",2020-05-25,

dairy AND yield,1ez7uw,Financing a new farm from scratch?,farming,23,0.9,"Hi! My wife and I, mid-thirties with impeccable credit, are interested in starting a new farm from scratch. We aren't interested in picking a commodity crop that does well in our area (Western Montana) and growing as much of it as we can, we'd prefer to dabble in a diversity of products - small goat dairy with value-adds, rabbitry, eggs, maybe some aquaculture, taking the time to grow a modest 500 or so tree orchard, berries, herbs, annual veggies, etc etc etc. A one-stop shop.

The thing with this, is that it takes *time* to build all this. Some of these products wont yield a materially harvestable amount for several years, such as the orchard.

In the event that we were able to secure financing for 100+ acres plus some equipment, how does financing work when you wont be grossing much in the way of revenue for a while? 

Is starting a new farm even a thing any more? Or do you kinda have to get in on an operation that is already established in the marketplace? 

tldr: Is there a way to finance a new farm that allows the farm to mature? 

edit: Really interesting dialogue going here. Thanks so much for all the replies. Upvotes all around. More about us, we currently own a house on 2 acres and have a handful of milk goats, rabbits, chickens. Yes our credit is 800+ each. I've got 15 years cross-industry business and financial management experience. She's got 7 + years of self-employment and has owned livestock of one kind or another all her life. We've explored Grade A dairy certification for where we're at, but don't see us growing beyond 8 milk goats here and infrastructure costs are too high to justify for that few. I love love love the idea of starting small and growing into it but if at least one of us is tied to a full-time in-city jobbie-job, we aren't going to be able to get enough land with our everyday cashflow (I'm talking even just 10 acres) where a commute is realistic. So how does one start small? If we could make a real run of it with the 2 acres we have, that'd be great, but I don't think that will cut it. Would love to hear that I am wrong though. ",2013-05-24,
dairy AND yield,1af668,Question for the grain farmers out there...,farming,11,0.92,"My wife and I run a small dairy on an island off the west coast of Canada.  Our grain prices have been rising steadily over the last several years - they're about 15-20% higher now compared to two years ago.

We're farming on 100 acres, of which only about 15 or so are used for grazing our livestock.  We have a good supply of manure, both chicken and ruminant, and I've been pondering the viability of putting 10 or so acres into barley or wheat.

* What sort of yield can one generally expect in my climate?  Our flat bottom fields are all rich peat.
* Related to the last question, if I'm shooting for about 20 or so tonnes per year, how many acres would I need in production?
* What sort of equipment (preferably small and inexpensive) would be best for farming at this scale?
* Are there good varieties that'd do well in our wetter climate out here?  (We're in BC, but the climate would be similar to Washington state or Oregon.)
* Do you think this a bad idea?  I'm entirely open to this being a bad idea. :)
* In my online research, I've come across an timey turnip/wheat/barley/clover rotation.  I'm aware it's more work, but the ability to close the loop on the bulk of our farm inputs is appealing.  Does anyone have any experience or advice on this sort of rotation?

dairy AND yield,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.73," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

I'm really most concerned about greenhouse gasses and land use, with anti-biotic resistance staying on my radar. Are these things to be concerned about? And what role do you think meat replacements- veg-meat and lab-grown meat- will play in the future due to these concerns?",2020-05-25,

I'm not shocked or surprised, especially since Leo financed Cowspiracy (which is now next on my to watch list), so I didn't expect this ""documentary"" to get their facts right either.  I'm open to other sources and debate, but here's what I found off starting at 50:57:

https://youtu.be/90CkXVF-Q8M?t=51m39s

&gt;[51:13 - ""I'm a scientist, thats the most important thing""](http://imgur.com/a/hPT85)

Gidon Eshel is a scientist that was picked for this ""documentary"", but his numbers are his and aren't backed by the EPA's scientists or are anywhere near what the EPA sends to the UN for GHG gases emitted for the agriculture sector.  He couldn't even get his land numbers correct and this is tracked via the census, so I have no idea where he got them and it shows simple flaws in his math.  

&gt;[51:44 - 47% of land in the US is used for food production](http://imgur.com/a/JcI3g)

From the [2012 US agricultural census](https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_1_US/usv1.pdf) it shows 914,527,657 acres of land is designated for farms.  The total amount of land in the US is 2,260,583,852 acres from page 318 of the census:

914,527,657 acres / 2,260,583,852 acres total acres = 40.45%

Of this 914,527,657 acres only 389,690,414 is used for crops. Also from the census 12,802,847 acres of pasture and grazing land that could have been used for crops without additional improvements, so a total of 402,493,261 acres (17.8% of land in the US) that could be used for crops and 512,034,396 (22.65%) that is used for grazing that is not fit for crops unless its improved by adding irrigation as an example. 100 acres of Nevada desert for grazing is nothing like 100 acres in Iowa to grow food on, if you're discussing land uses its misleading to group them all together.  Its also quite astounding that he's off by 148,068,242 acres (6.55%), that's about the same amount of land as the entire state of California and Nebraska combined, so he's not off by a little bit.  

The next caveat with this point is not everything we grow is just used for food, some examples from the census:

Nursery and floriculture production - 4,367,089 acres

Tobacco farming - 1,574,110 acres

Cotton farming - 11,157,031 acres

There's also 71,360,665 acres labelled other crop farming that doesn't fall under oilseed,  grains, fruits, vegetables, or for animals.  Sod and xmas tree farms come to mind as easy examples that would be part of this statistic.

&gt;[51:49 - 70% of land is used to feed cattle](http://imgur.com/a/oCSzq)

460,463,437 acres according to the census (page 61) is for all animal agriculture (not just cattle):

460,463,437 acres / 914,527,657 acres = 50.34% 

If I use his original number of 47% then it would be even less:

460,463,437 acres / 1,062,474,410 acres (47% of US land) = 43%

None of these numbers explain to people outside of agriculture the many uses of by products and why we need animals to recycle them.  An example is a farmer using sludge from a waste water treatment plant for fertilizer (regulations prevent it from entering human consumption) to grow a crop of corn for ethanol production which in turn uses the by product of distillers grains (a byproduct of alcohol production) as animal feed.  Animal agriculture is used to [reduce waste](https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reduce-wasted-food-feeding-animals) by using them to consume crops and by products that aren't fit for human consumption, he doesn't account for that in his statistics and I can only assume crops used for producing alcohol are counted against animal agriculture.

Of course again, he uses grazing land to pad this statistic.

&gt;[51:55 - 1% of this land is used for fruit, vegetables, and nuts](http://imgur.com/a/jMyV6) 

From the census (page 61) we can total the amount of acres for each:

Vegetable and melon farming - 8,206,468 acres

Fruit and tree nut farming - 13,162,702 acres

Food crops grown in greenhouses - 135,425 acres

Total 21,504,595 acres or 2.35% of all the land in the US (which is not his stat since its against agriculture land) designated for fruits and vegetables in agriculture production, but again that includes grazing land not suitable for crops.  We also import some fruits and vegetables (since we live in a global economy) that can't be grown in our climate, note that I'm a Canadian so maybe its more obvious to me.  

The actual statistic without using his other flawed numbers or including grazing land it would be 5.3%.

21,504,595 acres / 402,493,261 acres = 5.3%

&gt;52:06 ""Cows eat as much as they can""

Someone who raised beef they would know this isn't the case, they're called rations for a reason as over feeding can have environmental issues.

&gt;52:41 - ""About 10-12% of the total US emissions is due to beef""

This would be impossible since the entire agriculture sector is [9% of all US GHG emissions](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/medium/public/2016-05/ghge-sources-overview.png), from the EPA's numbers:

&gt;Breaking down the 4.2% EPA figure for livestock by animal species, shows the following contributors: beef cattle 2.2%, dairy cattle 1.37%, swine 0.47%, poultry 0.08%, sheep 0.03%, goats 0.01% and other (horses, etc.) 0.04%.

http://www.afia.org/rc_files/804/Mitloehner_us_livestock_ghg_05_05_2016.pdf

We see the same exageration in Canada, [yet the entire agriculture sector accounts for only 8%.](https://www.ec.gc.ca/ges-ghg/662F9C56-B4E4-478B-97D4-BAABE1E6E2E7/Figure-S-1_en.png)

&gt;[52:53 - 1/2 lb burger is equal to 42 miles of driving a Prius](http://imgur.com/a/v6wtu)

These comparisons are all from ""Livestocks Long Shadow"" and were [debunked here.](https://www.quora.com/How-accurate-is-the-movie-Cowspiracy)  Essentially they compare the entire production of beef to just burning fuel, they exclude the entire process to make fuel.

&gt;53:00 - The chicken will require 20% of the land and 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions, and if you compare rice potatoes, and wheat, beef requires 50 times as much land.

Ignores that pastures are different then cropland.  I get that some won't eat pigs for religious reasons, but pigs on a corn-fed diet can produce more calories per acre then beans.  Comparing carbohydrates to protein isn't a direct comparison, any agriculture scientist or farmer knows this.

Before I face the wrath of people who base their food ideologies they follow in life from sources like Gidon, I wanted to state for the record that I'm all for a carbon tax and fighting climate change, but people need a better education on agriculture they don't need to be mislead, especially if they feel the need to criticize it.

dairy AND fertilizer,aj24ht,Abandoning Urbanism for Re-ruralization,farming,22,0.73," We've been hearing about the problem of urban sprawl here in the US for decades now, especially its affects on the environment and proposed solutions such as mass transit. This would lessen some of the worst environmental impacts of our modern urban lives, but in some ways it may actually make the problem worse. Because as you spread transit networks out to reach more people and tie outlying areas into the wider network what you are doing is creating more opportunities for what is called by some “real estate development”, either in already populated places or in less densely settled areas.     
  This either adulterates and debases the beauty and splendor of our natural landscapes for the benefit of a few, or increases rents and overcrowds areas that are already intensively settled. This is what leads to the strange combination of circumstances that are experienced in southern California, urban sprawl and over crowding. The simple fact is that there are too many people living in the coastal areas of southern California. It affects our environment, our health and in all honestly our sanity.   
  Some good meaning folks mention and some delusional politicians ramble on about various proposed solutions to these twin menaces; again mass transit but also limited driving days and low cost housing projects. All these except the first are little more than band aids that will fail to solve the problems of overcrowding, a rising cost of living and environmental degradation. While as we have discussed the former actually can in the long term make them worse. Especially because when mass transit networks are over expanded and new areas come into settlement the number of people living in these areas who actually end up using mass transit will likely be fewer than those newcomers who will continue to drive .   
  In the long run our problem isn't that we don't have enough mass transit, it's that we have too many people living in too close proximity to each other; whether in southern California, Houston, Philadelphia or Seattle. Our cities and even our suburbs are overdeveloped and overcrowded, not just in California but across the country,     
  Take for example the town of Ellicott, Maryland. Here flooding of the local river, partly due to the soil's inability to absorb massive amounts of rainfall, caused streams of destruction to roll through the town and across our television screens; with many people's almost entire lives being washed away. This was partly due to the mass concretezation of vast tracts of land around the colonial-era town associated with new home and business construction. And who could forget the trauma of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. That disaster would not have occurred if businesses and people had not been allowed to settle in and “develop” an area of land so clearly fraught with danger, lying as it does below sea level so close to the coast.     
  Of course, then there are the chronic health risks of living in an overcrowded urban or urbanizing area such as respiratory issues arising from vehicle exhaust as well as cancers and birth defects due to industrial pollutants. Not only that but a recent study has suggested that these same pollutants are affecting educational performance, lowering both math and language scores for children living in these over-urbanized areas. A perhaps more immediate threat to the populations of our largest metropolitan regions can be found in the potential for the endemic spread of the new super bugs we've heard so much about from doctors and scientists. These being immune to our most advanced pharmacology could, once a severe enough breakout were to occur, easily and quickly spread through our most cramped and medically under served urban centers, with little time for the authorities to act.      
  Besides the physical and health risks associated with crowding such large groups of humanity together there are also the detrimental social impacts of a life spent imprisoned within the four walls of modernism. The sterility of the modern office robs man of his birth right, the joy of dominion over nature, the pride of marking the soil with the work of his own two hands. Instead he finds himself frozen in place surrounded by a cadre of gadgets and machines that he is told will solve all his problems, but in reality turn him into little more than a feckless child.      
  In this debased world of drudgery mankind becomes isolated and increasingly apathetic. People fill their time with an endless parade of distractions promoted by those who wish to see them remain shackled in oblivion. Among these are the vapid crazes of social radicalism taught in many of our universities, the cult of modern celebrity and sexual promiscuity.     
  Chained to such an existence we are consumed by presumption. **Always finding ourselves in competition with our neighbors,** either to have the latest product or pronounce the latest liberal talking point in order to “keep up with the Joneses”. All this in search of some specious urbanite utopia where we are told enjoyment will abound around every corner and we can be free of many of the negative consequences of our own actions. Of course this world can never truly exist and the results are a society depressed, obsessed with consumption and drowning in debt. Enslaved by both big finance and big tech man knows not where to turn. 	   
  The solution best suited to combat these ills will seem quite radical to some. It is the mass re-ruralization of our society, evacuating large swaths of major cities and resettling those populations in a dispersed manner across the countryside to embrace a return to the soil that will help us create a stabler, more sustainable and healthier society. This would clearly be a long and drawn out process, likely taking decades to accomplish and requiring the mobilization of enormous amounts of both material and human resources the likes of which few have ever seen.     
  The United States is a country endowed with abundant natural resources, amongst which are enormous amounts of arable land and forests. Cultivated acreage makes up only about 10% of land in our country, with less then 25% of this being used to grow food. Whereas urban and suburban areas take up only about 3**%**. If we take into consideration arable lands left fallow or being used for other purposes there is clearly enough land to accommodate the surplus populations of our cities and suburbs. Of course this may entail the movement of substantial population groups out of certain states and into others as the quality and quantity of arable land varies in different regions of the country.     
  These movements could be best accomplished or at least facilitated through a combination of tax policy and financial incentives. The first step in this direction would be to discourage urban living, primarily through the creation of two parallel tax regimes. With the basic tax structure for revenue collection from individuals maintained essentially in tact in rural areas, but at lower levels, while both income and property taxes would in the main rise over time in all non-rural districts. This will create the initial push factor that will propel a voluntary move away from the cities. This general policy will also apply to all companies and corporations involved in non-agricultural sectors of the economy, with the exception of those involved in the defense industry. Whereby many will help to undue the damage they have done to the people, most especially financial, technology and import oriented businesses.      
  These levies will be used to fund a program of agrarian incentives used to promote the re-establishment of the small to mid-sized family farm as the cornerstone of American society, acting as the concomitant      pull factor to the above mentioned urban and suburban disincentives. Among the former will be subsidies for the purchase of tools, livestock and grain supplies that will accompany the initial resettlement of populations.     
  To facilitate the creation of new small to mid-sized family farms a regime of lower property and sales tax rates will be instituted for small rural landholders and laborers, accompanied by intermittent multi-year tax holidays on both revenue sources for family farmers. Any financial shortfalls incurred by the state in furtherance of these policies will initially be made up for by an increase in both corporate and property taxes for industrial scale agribusiness and ranching.   
  To help those farmers who are already established an initial cancellation of debts will also be instituted for family landholders of longstanding who posses land below a certain acreage threshold, with distinct  qualifications established for the same purpose in regards to small and mid-sized livestock breeders. Additionally as protection against future financial predations all family farms and ranchs will be classed among a new category of business known as a hereditary enterprise, which will halt the practice of farm foreclosures by putting in place a moratorium on attempts to mortgage or sell any piece of a family farm. To ensure the continuity of these systemic reforms the holders of hereditary enterprises will be required to pass their property down to their eldest son upon retirement or after passing on.     
  These reforms would go a long way to addressing the grave imbalances caused by the so-called industrial revolution. The mechanization of farming being the main culprit in disrupting traditional ruralism. With the advent of the cotton gin (1793) and especially mechanical harvesters and threshers (1834) large landowners were in some ways able to cut their personnel and force all but the most fierce of their subsistence neighbors off their land. While the urban tycoons who came to prominence near the same time exploited the new technologies of mechanized weaving and other once artisanal trades to destroy the cottage industries of the villages and small towns. This gave these former merchants ineffable power over their sometime former partners.      
  This swelled the ranks of the rural unemployed, forcing them to swarm the cities in search of wage employment. Due to overcrowding and the *increase in food prices that followed these changes* people actually had a lower standard of living then before. You might ask yourself, using the logic of the industrial marketeer *'But wouldn't the efficiencies caused by mechanization lead to lower prices?'* The answer is no, since once industrial farmers purchased these foreclosed lands they turned their attention to increasing their own profits instead of continuing to use these lands for the common good**.** They did this by taking them out of cultivation and converting them to animal pasturage. This raised the prices of staple goods while lowering the price of many of the luxury foods craved by their urban counterparts, many of which were still out of reach of the average person. Of course mechanization also lead to an increase in slavery across the Americas due to the new ease of growing cotton.     
  The plight of the surviving small farmer did not end when he adapted himself to the exigencies of the modernizing world. Rather he has been slowly ground under foot by the radical economic and biological convulsions of what has been praised in liberal history books and international business circles as the “green revolution.” A sorry manipulation and homogenization of nature that serves to enrich industrial agribusiness at the expense of farmers as well as the general public.     
  This began with the introduction of new chemical fertilizers and pesticides that were touted as increasing crop yields and helping to solve the world's food crisis. And to a certain extent these technologies did help society to move towards these goals. But again the unforeseen consequences   of these developments have in many ways undermined their scanty benefits. From the higher rate of miscarriages and birth defects among agricultural workers to the likely carcinogenic nature of some of the most famous of these products, some of which can be found in our homes, the long-term health affects of exposure to these substances can be highly detrimental.     
  Later came GMOs (genetically modified crops and livestock) which were meant to be in many cases resistant to disease, drought and/or pests. The health affects of these products are unclear while separately the dominance they and their creators exercise over the agricultural market has led to a serious lack of diversity and security in our food supply. Societally we've become so dependent on the production of such a limited number of varieties of foodstuffs that any future unanticipated outbreak of disease, for which no provision was made in the genetic makeup of these products, could wipe out vast amounts of our grain and animal stocks. Leaving us again vulnerable to food shortages and famine in the long run.     
  And just as with the advent of mechanization such technologies have had a ruinous affect on most small farmers. Again it is the large agribusinesses that are best able to afford the expense involved in implementing these technologies, whether it be purchasing seeds engineered to produce greater yields of grain or cows imbued with hormones to produce larger quantities of milk. They are then able to flood the market with their produce, lowering prices for all such goods and destroy any profit that the small farmer may have hoped to gain.     
  Not only does the family farmer fall a prey to his larger competitors due to these technologies, but he is also at times victimized by the large multinationals who develop them. In a step seemingly aimed at the eventual total monetization of nature some of these companies have sought and received intellectual property rights over the seeds they have engineered. This allows for litigation against any farmer who has seeds from a GMO crop on a neighbor's property blown onto his own and inadvertently lets it grow there. This is yet another substantial financial hurtle put in the way of the small family farmer by the power of international business interests. This will again ruin many small farmers and give agribusiness access to even more cheapened foreclosed lands.   
  Besides crippling the small family farmer these industrial agri-interests likewise don't necessarily put the interests of the American people first. Rather some concentrate on cultivating large cash crops for sale in foreign markets; focusing on satiating outside demand at a profit instead of working to feed the masses of Americans who struggle to afford nutritious and healthy meals. While those focused on domestic markets often sell their produce to the large commercial purveyors of street foods that are lolling our youth into a fat saturated state of sloven indolence.          
  Work must thus be undertaken to undo the great harm caused by the unbarred metastasization of these industrial agri- and ranching interests and restore our society to the purity and beauty it once embodied. As such the lands so brazenly occupied by these liberal marketeers over about two centuries should be returned to the people. The most effective way to accomplish this would be through a staggered process of land expropriation that would see these corporations' mammoth domains divided up and parceled out as private property to the influx of new rural residents that would coincide with the implementation of the the aforementioned re-ruralizing policies.     
  However to avoid the perils of Marxism it may be necessary to recognize that some of these interests *may have* made material improvements in the condition of these lands and to provide them with some form of basic compensation. Those corporations best suited to the task will thus be reformed under law into agencies with the right to re-educate the new rural populations in the practices of agriculture and livestock rearing, funded and strictly overseen by the state. The rest, being unfit for this purpose, will be dissolved and their assets seized.     
  In this vision of agrarian reform the nationalization of the **farm credit system** would also be necessary so as to take it out of the hands of  its current masters, agribusiness profiteers. Nominally under the authority of the independent federal Farm Credit Administration this group functions as a farming Federal Reserve; owned by its members and controlling the financing of all rural commercial initiatives in the country with limited independent oversight. Indeed half of the FCA's board is appointed by this lobby group.     
  In contrast what we need is an agricultural support regime under the direct authority of the state through this same agency, with the recipients of such government largess unable to appoint their own overseers. As part of this general reform the system's “Federal” Land Banks and Intermediate Credit Banks along with their respective districts should be kept in place. With these bodies helping to facilitate the purchase of further real property and farming implements once the initial bouts of re-ruralization have been completed. Meanwhile the system's District Banks for Cooperatives would eventually be wound down in as much as when state aid for family farmers becomes sufficiently plentiful agricultural cooperatives will become obsolete.     
  The process for attaining credit under these new conditions will be simplified by the removal of the requirement to buy stock in any number of Land Bank or Production Credit associations in order to receive a loan. The previous system's practice of granting control of said organizations to their biggest stockholders (i.e. biggest debtors) will come to an end. This approach marginalized small farmers and empowered those with the excess capital required to purchase influence in such organizations, that is the liberal marketeers who direct industrial agribusiness. These changes will thus see the shuttering of said associations and an end to their control not only over the financing of all agricultural enterprises in the country, but additionally the erasure of their erstwhile authority over America's wider agricultural policy.   
  As greater numbers of people become increasingly self sufficient in terms of food production the marketing and business services cooperatives that function as extensions of the Banks for Farm Cooperatives will also be phased out. This because large scale merchandising of foodstuffs will become redundant except for governmental purposes. These include provisioning for the armed forces and the creation of food stockpiles for emergency purposes. These necessities are well known and have no need to be marketed to in the present coarse fashion.     
  At the moment much of the financial support garnered for the functioning of these various bodies is acquired through the floating of securitized debt instruments to the public. However, as the entirety of this mechanism will be brought under the direct auspices of the central government this practice too will be terminated. In place of such revenue sources the system will receive support directly from the state. Whereas the people are now held liable for any losses incurred by the decisions of the merchant-chieftains who lead these groups without any real authority over them, under this revitalization of ruralism the state will be at once both accountable for such failures and capable of guiding policy in a manner more conducive to the true flowering and sustainability of the rural economy.     
  With such financing and governance issues resolved this new agricultural aide regime will be free to grant farmers who are struggling the assistance they really need. Operating loans will  regularly be renewed, unless there is some grave         , allowing farmers to plan for the long term and no longer live in fear of farm bankruptcy. Loans will never more be granted which expose the small family farmer to the vagaries of financial markets, with adjustable rate financing eliminated and all loans granted at below market rates in order to give those who work with their hands and actually produce the leeway they need to survive. While smaller farmers who incorrectly followed the example of the liberal marketeers and engaged in classes of production dependent on large mass markets, such as dairy and soy farming, will receive special incentives to diversify away from said practices. That said the accompanying margin-protection insurance programs that went along with such           will also be dismantled.   In order to guarantee strict oversight of these agencies and further the goal of restoring our society to its former strength a dramatic transformation of the form and usage of national government will be required. Parts of what are now federal departments will be eliminated while their remainders in some cases will have to be conglomerated to facilitate a better co-ordination of the processes necessary to see this great goal through. For example, the creation of a Department for Housing and Re-ruralization comprised of element from the former departments of agriculture, housing and urban development and education as well as the EPA.      To accomplish this we will need the work of a strong unflinching government, perhaps much mightier than anything our current system is capable of producing. Our federalist government with its constant alterations of rule by misguided and selfish cliques could likely never accomplish a social transformation as grand as the one discussed here. Both its inability to develop and implement long range plans and in many respects its beholdeness to international business interests suggest a change in the structure and makeup of our government will be required to see these changes set in motion. What we need is a form of government free of the corrosive social inclinations that accompanied the 'modernization' and mechanization of society.     
  In short what we need is a monarchy; a government unafraid to take the reins and guide society in a direction all too often ignored and looked down upon by those who have told us they have all the answers. These people have failed to secure the true well being of our people in many ways. Whether in terms of employment, where just as with the introduction of mechanization we are suffering from mass joblessness (at about 28% according to the government's own figures), or as regards our health, bombarded as we are with the harmful chemical cocktails that swirl about us both in our rural and non-rural settings.  	   
  Escaping from the toxic mileau manipulated into existence over the past few centuries will be a daunting long term process. It will take generations to complete and entail in many ways a complete reconsideration of how our society is organized and run. The challenge is great but even greater is the will to see the wrongs of the past undone, This is a struggle in which we can not fail. And indeed once we marshal all the resources of society to our side there can be no doubt that we will together restore society to its true equilibrium, where man is again free from the toils and corruptions of modernism just as God intended.

dairy AND denmark,2rb2nc,Zookeeper-to-be looking for ranch work! Tips appreciated.,farming,3,0.67,"Hi guys!
Not sure if this is the right sub, but you can hopefully give me some tips if not a job.

I'm 25 years old and have just started the zoo keeper education in Denmark, which takes about 4 years. 
In those 4 years, we will be going on internships 4 times and my first time will be in mid-march 2015. We have to find this ourselves and farm work is highly appreciated by the future employers. 

Working on a farm is a valuable experience, in a field where the internships are few and you have to show that you don't mind hard work and are independent enough to go abroad by yourself. 
I know what hard work is (was in the army for 3 years) and I have been travelling and doing volunteer work in Africa and South America, but 3-6 months on a ranch, would be different from what I've already tried and I'm keen to go!

Yes, I know that I will get all the shitty jobs and that it will be all about hard work, but I'm ready to learn the hard way.

Do any of you know of any farms hiring from march/april? 
I would equally love to go to Canada, America or Australia, but if you know of any other opportunities, let me know.
As said before, tips for this kind of work is appreciated as well.",2015-01-04,

dairy AND price,15oanwh,Milk price payment for farmers,dairyfarming,7,0.67,"I want first hand opinion from you guys regarding the price you get for the milk being produced on farm.
As far as it's my understanding,  a farmer gets into a contract with a processor/co-operative,  to whom they sell their milk. And for each kg of milk, the farmer is given a specific price.
Now, I have the following question.
1. For how long these contracts are for (1 year, 2 year etc) ?

I ask this because I am working on a model, to see how much milk price is given to dairy farmers in different regions in a year.

Now in some parts of the year (spring mostly) the milk price is lower as compared to  price in autumn/winter.
Now I understand, the dairy farmers are calving their cows just before spring so that their cows are giving the highest amount of milk in the time when there is abundant availability of feed. 

But what if you were to shift this calving by 4-5  month only, understandably you will have to ensure the abundance of feed in the seasons when the feed availability is less but you will be getting highest milk prices, while the herd will be producing the highest amount of milk. 

Any insights,  comments or feedback will be highly appreciated.

The problem is that I'm having a heck of a time finding any dairy veterinarians that actually list their prices online. I've reached out to a dairy vet/professor who teaches at my school for help, but she's super busy and I haven't heard back yet, so I thought I'd give it a go here.

My main questions are:

What would you expect to pay in the U.S. (per hour or per animal) for a veterinarian to vaccinate your calves/cows?

How long would you expect it to take for a veterinarian to vaccinate, say, 50 animals?

I know that MOST disease prevention depends upon you all having good animal management/husbandry, but is there preventive care that you'd like veterinarians to offer that they currently don't?

Do you have a vet out for consultations on disease prevention when your animals are all healthy, or would you only call a vet when you have animal health problems?

[GIPHY.com](https://i.redd.it/7dyh3s8l1i071.gif)

*Let’s just say milk pricing is about as simple as a graduate-level statistics course…*

So it was no surprise last month when the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) [asked](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cubm1wZi5vcmclMkZkYWlyeS1mYXJtZXJzLXRvLXNlZWstZW1lcmdlbmN5LXVzZGEtaGVhcmluZy1vbi1jbGFzcy1pLW1vdmVyLXJlZm9ybSUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3052) the USDA for an emergency hearing regarding milk pricing structure. But - *real talk* \- not all dairy farmers have a “glass half full” view of the proposal.

**Refresher:** Milk sales are regulated by Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) that set milk prices based on the class (intended use) of the milk.

Class I milk prices (the jug in your fridge) are [calculated](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cueWFua2VlZmFybWNyZWRpdC5jb20lMkZibG9nJTJGanVseS0yMDIwJTJGYS1uZWdhdGl2ZS1wcGQtZXhwbGFpbmVkJTNGY2F0ZWdvcnlpZCUzRDE3&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3053) based on the average of cheese (Class III) and powder milk (Class IV), with an added premium.

**Enter the ‘rona:** COVID-19 messed with the milk market big time in 2020. As cheese prices influenced fluid prices, dairy farmers took the ultimate hit. The NMPF’s proposal seeks to change price structuring...and make up for some 2020 losses.

But some producers are saying, “*hold your* *~~horses~~* *holsteins*.”

In a letter sent to Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack, five Midwestern [dairy groups](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cud2lzZmFybWVyLmNvbSUyRnN0b3J5JTJGbmV3cyUyRjIwMjElMkYwNSUyRjE0JTJGZGFpcnktZ3JvdXBzLXN0cmVzcy1ob2xpc3RpYy1hcHByb2FjaC10by1taWxrLXByaWNpbmctcmVmb3JtJTJGNTA5MTU3NDAwMSUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3054) put forth their own proposal dubbed *Class III Plus*.

The Class III Plus crew says that their [proposal](https://magnetic37812.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYWdkYWlseS5jb20lMkZsaXZlc3RvY2slMkZkYWlyeS1ncm91cHMtY2xhc3MtaWlpLXBsdXMtYmV0dGVyLW1pbGstcHJpY2luZyUyRg==&amp;a=476427287&amp;account=magnetic37812%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=e3mgRoNVQgYxeAJyRxJsXI6PoBrzHozLLG6hm6AgcEQ%3D&amp;s=d49a9e4b6eecc40c8f41057bd43812bb&amp;i=90A98A1A3055) provides future stability, allows for better risk management, and does not increase long-term consumer prices.

**Soundbite:** ""*\[The NMPF proposal\] attempts to claw back lost revenue in the short term and leaves larger problems unsolved. Our organizations prefer sensible changes that will last for decades,*"" noted Amy Penterman, president of the Dairy Business Association.

**Bottom line:** The groups aren’t pushing for an emergency FMMO hearing. But if it happens, they say the discussion needs to be broader in scope and “tackle more than just Class I pricing.”

* First phase introduced in January
* UK says it will maintain smooth flow of imported goods
* Businesses say checks will cause disruption, raise prices

Britain launched physical checks on fresh food products imported from the European Union on Tuesday some three years after it left the bloc's single market and eight years after it voted to leave the EU.

While Britain's major supermarkets and large EU exporting businesses have greater resources to handle the paperwork and new demands, smaller retailers and wholesalers [have warned](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/new-brexit-border-checks-could-stifle-fine-food-imports-eu-warn-sellers-2024-04-22/) of delays and disruption and said consumers should expect a reduced variety of quality goods, less fresh produce and higher prices.

The first phase of Britain's so called new Border Target Operating Model, requiring [additional certification](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-industry-fears-disruption-new-post-brexit-border-checks-2024-01-23/), came into force on Jan. 31.

A [second phase](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-are-new-post-brexit-border-controls-starting-april-30-2024-04-22/) kicked off on Tuesday introducing physical checks at ports for so called ""medium risk"" animal products, plants and plant products, such as meat, fish, cheese, eggs, dairy products and certain cut flowers. New charges have also been introduced.

Britain had repeatedly delayed imposing checks on EU imports. By contrast, the EU immediately enforced its rules, leading to port delays in 2021 and prompting some British exporters, such as cheese-makers and high-end beef farmers, to give up on selling to the bloc, at least initially.",2024-04-30,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britain-starts-physical-checks-fresh-food-imports-eu-2024-04-30/

The prominent role of agriculture was enshrined in the European Union’s founding documents as a way of ensuring food security for a continent still traumatized by the deprivations of World War II. But it was also a nod to national identities and a way to protect competing farming interests in what would become a common market.

dairy AND ireland,kwdecm,The first effects of Brexit: products not allowed at the border and no fruit in many shops,europeanunion,16,0.97," Netherlands border agents confiscated yesterday all the ham and cheese sandwiches an English gentleman arriving by ship from the [United Kingdom ](https://theworldreviews.com/how-united-kingdom-learns-to-protects-its-own-well-in-time/)brought with him. The man asked why and the border officials explained that because of the Brexit, it is no longer allowed to import this type of product. **“Sorry, sir. This is Brexit.”** One of the agents said. That is an emblematic scene of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union effects. 

The agents strictly but correctly applied the new rules. Because from 11 pm on 31 December 2020, the UK officially left the European single market. And although Boris Johnson snatched a theoretically zero duty tariff-free trade agreement from the last, this still implies a huge number of customs declarations, up to tens of millions per year. But above all, some fresh products can no longer enter the European Union freely from the United Kingdom, now a non-EU country, even if you are a tourist, exactly, as it already happens at the US border. 

The rule applies above all to meat (whether fresh or cured) and cheeses and dairy products, for reasons of safety and health, as similar foods must be checked in advance by the authorities to avoid importing diseases. The United Kingdom, unlike the EU, still allows tourists and ordinary citizens to bring the ham, cheese, and in general dairy products and meats, if these come from the EU, also because however London cannot yet carry out such checks. So, barring a few misinformed British border agents, as the rules are, it is still possible to bring sandwiches, cold cuts, and cheeses from the EU to the UK, a rather common practice for many migrant workers and visitors.

Meanwhile, fruit and vegetables are starting to run out in an increasing number of UK supermarkets, as explained by an alarmed Daily Mail, one of the country’s most pro-Brexit newspapers. In Britain, the cause of the problem is the long lines of trucks seen in Dover in late December. When French President Emmanuel Macron closed the borders to stop the English coronavirus variant. The blockade and the long waiting discouraged many factories from shipping goods and merchandise at the Brexit beginning.

In Northern Ireland too, goods are starting to run out. The problem here is that, in turn, goods from Great Britain to and around Belfast have to undergo customs checks and declarations, although this takes place within the UK. According to the Brexit agreement between the Boris Johnson government and Brussels, London has to check many products before crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland.

The latter remained in the customs union and EU single market. The decision came to avoid re-installing the border between the two Irish countries and to preserve peace between them. ***Therefore, all goods from the UK must be checked and selected as if crossing an EU country border.***",2021-01-13,

In the start it was mainly dairies, where farmers instead of selling their milk to someone else, joined together in an area and formed their own dairies, in Danish called *Andelsmejerier*. This movement actually ended up toppling the established large diaries in the early 20th century, and the largest dairy in Denmark today, Arla, is a cooperative, it even spans into Sweden and Norway.

The movement is also present in retail. In many small towns and villages, the inhabitants joined together to make their local shops able to keep business, in Danish these shops are referred to as *Brugsforeninger*. This movement slowly centralised and nowadays the largest retailing concern in Denmark is COOP, which is, you guessed it, also a cooperative.

So a little background: within the past years I've dropped 100+ pounds and really adopted a healthy lifestyle. Been doing CF for 11 months now and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences. My issue is that I know absolutely nothing about nutrition and everything is essentially self-taught.

When I originally lost all my weight it was through the mindset of cut calories + lots of cardio = lose weight (which kind of wrecked my current mindset today). Worked for a bit until I hit a MAJOR plateau and actually started gaining weight. Fast forward to starting CF, tracking macros, and doing intermittent fasting and I'm FINALLY happy with my weight and my physical appearance (woohoo!) 

I originally used the IIFYM calculator and lowered carb + fat intake cause it seemed like WAY too much, but after speaking with a few CF friends I'm wondering if I'm eating WAY less than I should be. I'm so shitty at ""listening to my body"" but my goal is to remain primarily lean but increase visibility of muscles and abs, but also perform efficiently during WODs (so unsure if I should be cutting...maintaining..or bulking)

Currently I eat: 165P / 190C / 65F for a total of 2005 calories. For the most part, I eat very clean, aside from random weekend drinking escapades. I meal prep my lunch every day (vegetables, protein, fruit, nuts, dairy, whole wheat grains) and cook dinner every day as well (eggs, whole wheat grains, whole wheat pasta, etc.) Even though I'm really happy with where I'm at (especially considering where I started at almost 300 lbs) I'm really just looking for some insight into eating healthier and continuously bettering myself.

I have been thinking a lot about dairy lately. I don't really have any problems with it (mainly consume Skyr/Greek Yogurt), but is it really such a great source of nutrients compared to eggs, chicken, beef and other animal proteins? 

As you can tell I'm mainly doing dairy for the protein. Sometimes I do Greek yogurt for breakfast AND dinner. Doesn't need cooking and I can throw in a few eggs on the side, but wouldn't it be a heck more nutrient dense to do like eggs for breakkie, chicken for lunch and beef for dinner, skipping the dairy totally? I've always praised dairy for three convenience but starting to think I've fooled myself just looking at the protein and price. A few years ago I never did dairy (lived at home and my mom is lactose intolerant) and I freaking thrived in meats, chicken &amp; fish. Training went great. But maybe it's severly biased to me thinking it was only the dairy exclusion.

After watching some diet and nutrition videos and reading some articles, I realize that some of the ""run of the mill"" grocery store meat / dairy sources may not be the best for you.

For example, ground turkey is an extremely good source of protein on paper. However according to a video I recently watched, most turkeys which are processed and become ground turkey are fed a diet high in Soy which leads to increased estrogen and other undesirable hormones within the meat.

Then after watching that video, I started looking at organic meats, grass-fed beef, non-GMO food, etc and realized that the prices are obviously a bit higher than ""regular"" meat/dairy products.

In this video Dr. Berry talks about:

 1. Nutrient density: Agree

2. Carbohydrate intake: ""*Unlike protein (amino acids) and lipids (fatty acids), there are no carbohydrates essential for human life that the body does not produce. Therefore, modulate carbohydrate intake based on how your body responds to them (i.e., if you experience inflammation or other health problems, try reducing your carbohydrate intake).*"" Agree to an extent.

3. Food sensitivity: Agree

4. Satiety: Agree

5. Fasting: Agree

6. Ancestral appropriateness: ""*Eat mostly foods that humans have eaten for millions of years, such as fatty meats, organ meats, and some plants. Be cautious of foods that humans have eaten for only thousands of years, such as grains, dairy, and alcohol. Avoid foods that humans have only eaten for tens to hundreds of years, such as vegetable/seed oils and highly-processed foods.*"" I have no clue where to start on this... truly, as in I don't know if there's any truth to this or not. Any thoughts? He talks about the vegetable oils and while I know that ""vegetable"" oil isn't good, there are many fantastic fats in canola, safflower, and olive oil.

7. Avoid factory products: Agree, but also some processed foods are really there for convenience of nutrition, so when possible go natural but it's often very difficult to.

8. Adequate minerals: No thoughts

9. Avoid fad diets: ""*The ketogenic diet may seem like a fad but it is actually well-documented in cultures around the world over the course of history. In contrast, modern dietary recommendations have only existed for a few decades and are largely influenced by politics and lobbying.*"" Thoughts on this statement? He also calls pyramid and MyPlate a fad diet made by ""big dairy, etc"". MyPyramid was indeed a mess, but MyPlate, and especially Harvard's version have been vital in helping people.

10. Sugar addiction: Agree

11. Price vs quality: ""*High-quality products are more expensive than low-quality products.

ever since getting some bloodwork done and finding out that my blood sugar levels are higher than usual, i've been trying to get them back to a healthy state. a good chunk of my family has diabetes and i'm not wanting to get it myself. i know genetics play a pretty big role, but i can fight that with a healthful diet and being more active. 


in theory, anyway.  in practice is a whole 'nother story. i saw a nutritionist and we made a whole diet overhaul plan that includes so so so many vegetables, no dairy (suspected casein intolerance), up to one serving of whole wheat bread/whole grain crackers per day, add meat (used to be a vegetarian, now dabbling in chicken and fish), no added sugars, 70%+ dark chocolate only, no cocktails, ...  it's hard. it's expensive. and it's no fun. 


i'm trying to hit the gym 5 times a week for at least 30 minutes, but it's averaging more like 3 times a week, for an hour per time.  i also walk about 4 miles per day outside of the gym and go dancing a lot. 


in the past 3 months i've lost 15 pounds and gained back 10. and i was miserable - missing my favorite foods, never feeling sated, not having any energy despite eating millions of grams of protein, stressing over cooking, feeling the effects of the low-carb flu. it was awful. 


so i've decided to add dairy back in - having slightly congested ears is a small price to pay for the internal hug that cheese gives. casein &gt; opiates to me. oh yes indeed. and i'm baking my own whole wheat bread/pizza crust with flax and chia seeds; i'm still eating minimal amounts, but baking my own bread is a thing that relaxes me.  baking is meditative. and i still don't really like the taste of meat, but i can do white meat chicken and lighter-flavored fish with little fuss. i can make hummus in my sleep, and that's a mainstay now. a garlicky, garlicky mainstay. and eggs, so many eggs. and avocados. and once a week i splurge on a really well-made old fashioned, sometimes two.


doing all that has greatly helped my mood and overall feelings of well-being, but i can't seem to drop the weight again. the 10 lb regain happened before i made the 2nd set of dietary changes, and i was really hoping that my better mindstate would help get the pounds off again, and encourage more to go, too, but as of yet no dice. i do feel better overall, though, with more energy and a generally better attitude. with a few more tweaks, i'm hopeful that i'll find the right combination of everything.  


TL;DR: what are some of the ways y'all have healthfully gotten over plateaus?",2015-03-03,
dairy AND price,23rj7o,So many questions...,nutrition,10,0.67,"This post might end up kind of text-heavy, sorry.

So I've been indepedently studying nutrition and the science behind it for probably ten years, and there are still some vital things I don't understand.

Low-carb diets is what I'll start with, because they seem fairly solid to me. Alright, and...

How is it that any scientist worth their salt can say that carbohydrates, for more than ten thousand years, have not been a major part of the diet? It is true that some select groups such as the Inuit and other hunter-gatherer tribes living pre-agricultural lifestyles didn't eat much in the way of grains, but those tribes living in places where those things did exist were obsessed with them. In Japanese and Chinese, the word for food is the same as the word for rice. 

The Incas and Mayans had corn. The First Nations tribes of North America were known to grow beans, squash, and corn together - it's called ""Three Sisters"" planting. Barley, watered wine, and olive oil were the main foods of ancient Greece. Calculus on the teeth of human skeletons from the Paleolithic Era have been shown to contain detritus from grains. A form of fermented grain porridge, the precursor to beer, was the most important foodstuff of ancient Egypt.

As you can see, these grains have formed not only a part, but at many times the absolute sum of many diets. Prior to the cultural revolution in China, the peasants ate very little other than corn and millet. Many, many whole grains have been essential staples of diets all over the world from pre-history to the present day.

These people eating these foods typically did not suffer from the ""Diseases of Affluence"" - obesity, diabetes, heart failure, etc - that are attributed by Atkins/Paleo proponents as the effect of high-carbohydrate diets. But it's pretty clear that fat, meat, and salt aren't the culprits either.

There's the body of evidence proposed by the Weston A. Price Foundation, based on the century-old musings of a dentist astonished by the beautiful dentition of pre-industrialized societies and his attribution of their lovely smiles and good bone structures to their diet. 

The Weston A. Price Foundation bases many of its suppositions on remarkably shaky grounds - it pushes dairy and organ meats incredibly heavily, as well as bone broths and a huge variety of fermented foods. I'm not saying they are inherently wrong, but I think that if everyone ate as much liver as the Weston A. Price foundation thought we should, the price of dog food would be seriously affected.

Then there are the raw foodists - raw vegans and non-vegans who feel that the best nutrition is gotten out of food by not cooking it. There's a lot of evidence against this, though. We know that many foods have their nutritional benefits brought out by cooking, and that many raw foods contain serious antinutrients that inhibit our absorption of the necessary vitamins and minerals from our food.

I think that like the medieval europeans, whose pewter plates leached lead when acidic tomatoes were placed on them, we have drawn some wrong conclusions from some staggeringly odd observations with little basis in scientific fact. I think there's a huge failure here to see the big picture, and that so many competing theories basically destroy the likelihood of there being actual money put towards such a fascinating field of study which, up until now, has suffered from a huge amount of junk science, ethically compromised research, and general misinformation. 

What do you think works?

TL;DR Almost every aspect of nutrition science is upside down and backwards. What do we do about it?

EDIT : I forgot to mention one of the most important things; a lot of evidence exists that humans evolved as pursuit predators, and it may be that most of our time is meant to be spent in heavy physical exertion and that in societies which rely entirely upon human physical labour for their sustenance and economy, high carbohydrate diets may well be the only thing we can consume in adequate amounts to sustain the energy required for those lifestyles, but that since the first world doesn't generally do that, reasonably low-carb diets might be key to the formation of healthy societies.",2014-04-23,

Obviously physical well-being and mental health are not exactly seperate entities but your hard pressed to find diets that value cognition over chiseled abs. So the question I pose is this...

What foods, dietary habits, vitamins, supplements et cetera.. would you include in a theoretical diet that disregards the physique in the interest of cognition and emotional well-being.

To clarify, I'm not asking for a list of ""comfort foods"" here. A diet of chocolate and ice cream may make one feel better momentarily but no ones brain is going to work better on it. Nor is anyone going to yield a strong emotional state as a result.

So I'm curious. What would your theoretical ""brain"" diet look like.

Mine (thus far) looks like this:

-Lower calorie intake (1400-1700)
-Intermittent Fasting (one large meal a day)
-Run/Jog about 30 miles a week or more.
-No refined sugar, grains, dairy or meat (causes cravings impacting mental health)
-No soy or chocolate (I am allergic/intolerant)
-Minimal table salt (celtic sea salt is fine)
-Lots of kale, spinach, collard and mustard greens. Next in line is a ton of broccoli, peppers and chili's and celery. Almonds, cashews, coconut milk/cream (unsweetened), seaweed and nutritional yeast. Hemp protein and brown rice protein (both plain unflavored).
-drinking water and coffee only
-spicing everything with lots of black pepper, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, dill, cardamon, chili pepper, basil, savory, oregeno, and sage. also using vinegar for flavor.
-Supplement with Omega 3 (fish oil), DHEA, Baccopa (optional not constant), Glycine, Glutamine (optional not constant), b-vitamins (mostly 6, 12 and 1) and DLPA.

Bear in mind this is MY theoretical ""brain"" diet. I don't suggest this for anyone else, nor do I believe this to be the most nutritionally sound plan for physical well-being. With that said, I have lived on this for about 2 months now and feel freakin' fantastic. No cravings for anything (after the initial week or so after giving up dairy and meat) not emotional instability (i used to be quite moody and dealt with moderate bouts of depression I linked to dairy and certain meats) can focus and work longer hours, never feel physicall or mentally drained, and as a bonus I've lost weight.",2013-05-13,
dairy AND yield,4g4q4x,Can anyone help with lactose intolerance questions?,nutrition,9,0.91,"This may be TMI but with lactose intolerance I guess you guys need to know...


So my whole life I've *believed* I was lactose intolerant. Whenever I'd consume milk I'd bloat, have horrid gas and abdominal pain, and sometimes I'd wish I would just throw up because it hurt so bad. I've operated under this assumption for the majority of my life and just avoided milk, save for a few splurges which were definitely uncomfortable but totally worth it. I drank Lactaid milk without any issue, eat margarine instead of butter (even though it's icky) and typically go without everything else dairy (ice cream, cream cheese, cheese in general because vegan cheese is nasty).


But I was recently in a position to have some raw milk. I've read studies that people who are lactose intolerant find they tolerate raw milk just fine, so I gave it a go. I drank the stuff for an extended period of time (several months) with no symptoms! It was awesome! 


Then I started reading that foods like aged hard cheeses and butter typically don't have any lactose in them. I was so encouraged by the raw milk results that I gave that a go as well, with horrible consequences. The bloating, gas, and abdominal pain was pretty bad... I may as well have just ingested a glass of pasteurized milk for all the symptoms I experienced.


Does anyone know why this is? Why raw milk is fine, but products that say right on them that they contain 0g of lactose (thinking about [Cabot cheese](https://www.cabotcheese.coop/extra-sharp-cheddar-cheese-dairy-bar)) result in lactose intolerance symptoms? And from there, why something like butter, which [apparently should be OK](http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2012/07/some_dairy_products_may_be_ok.html) also results in the same symptoms!


I've done my research and these are internal symptoms, not external, so it's not a milk allergy. I just don't know what it could be, and my google searching is not really yielding any results. I did read that margarine has been linked to allergies, but I don't know if that could be the cause of my inconsistent dairy intolerance. 


Any help would be lovely. Thanks guys, you're the best!


Note: This is not asking for medical advice, I'm just looking for any ideas out there to help explain inconsistent dairy intolerance so I can do more research =)",2016-04-23,
dairy AND yield,52ggrj,Food Industry Funding of Nutrition Research,nutrition,2,0.94,"Hot off the press - just published today:

https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251

by Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH in *JAMA Intern Medicine*, September 12, 2016

&gt; Industry-sponsored nutrition research, like that of research sponsored by the tobacco, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, almost invariably produces results that confirm the benefits or lack of harm of the sponsor’s products, even when independently sponsored research comes to opposite conclusions.1 Although considerable evidence demonstrates that those industries deliberately influenced the design, results, and interpretation of the studies they paid for,2 much less is known about the influence of food-company sponsorship on nutrition research. Typically, the disclosure statements of sponsored nutrition studies state that the funder had no role in their design, conduct, interpretation, writing, or publication. Without a “smoking gun” it is difficult to prove otherwise.

&gt; In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Kearns and colleagues3 report on having found a smoking gun. From a deep dive into archival documents from the 1950s and 1960s, they have produced compelling evidence that a sugar trade association not only paid for but also initiated and influenced research expressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Although studies at that time indicated a relationship between high-sugar diets and CHD risk, the sugar association preferred scientists and policymakers to focus on the role of dietary fat and cholesterol. The association paid the equivalent of more than $48 000 in today’s dollars to 3 nutrition professors—at Harvard no less—to publish a research review that would refute evidence linking sugars to CHD.

&gt; The sponsored review appeared in 2 parts in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. Its authors acknowledged support from the industry-funded Nutrition Foundation, but they did not mention the sugar association’s specific funding of their review. Their first article demonstrates a close correlation between sugar and fat “consumption” (actually amounts in the food supply) and mortality in 14 countries (Figure).4 To minimize the association with sugar, the authors seem to have cherry-picked existing data. Despite their having previously published studies linking both fats and sugars to CHD risk, their review gave far more credence to studies implicating saturated fat than it did to those implicating sugars.

&gt; The documents leave little doubt that the intent of the industry-funded review was to reach a foregone conclusion. The investigators knew what the funder expected, and produced it. Whether they did this deliberately, unconsciously, or because they genuinely believed saturated fat to be the greater threat is unknown. But science is not supposed to work this way. The documents make this review seem more about public relations than science.

&gt; This 50-year-old incident may seem like ancient history, but it is quite relevant, not least because it answers some questions germane to our current era. Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues. In 2015, the New York Times obtained emails revealing Coca-Cola’s cozy relationships with sponsored researchers who were conducting studies aimed at minimizing the effects of sugary drinks on obesity.5 Even more recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how a candy trade association funded and influenced studies to show that children who eat sweets have healthier body weights than those who do not.6 The results of such studies have obvious implications for public health.

&gt; For this reason, it is of more than academic interest to find out when food companies began to fund research for public relations purposes. Fred Stare, then chair of Harvard’s nutrition department and senior author of the 1967 review, began soliciting donations from food companies in the early 1940s but insisted that these be unrestricted and pooled into a common fund for research and education.7 If earlier examples to the contrary occurred, they were not disclosed. If nothing else, the analysis by Kearns et al3 makes it clear why full disclosure of funding sources is essential.

&gt; In addition, their study is highly relevant to ongoing debates about the relative harm of fats and sugars. By 1967, as the Figure shows, both sugar and saturated fat had been identified as mortality risk factors. But for decades following the funded review, scientists and dietary guidelines focused on reducing saturated fat as the primary strategy for CHD prevention. They also advised consuming sugars in moderation, but mainly to prevent tooth decay. Today, the balance has shifted to less concern about fat and much greater concern about sugars.

&gt; It is worth noting that this debate focuses on sugars and saturated fats rather than on the foods that contain them. This approach, termed “nutritionism” to refer to the reductive use of single nutritional factors to stand for foods and dietary patterns, is inherently misleading.8 In excess, both sugars and saturated fat are markers of Western dietary patterns high in calories from meat, processed foods, and sugary drinks, all associated with increased chronic disease risk.9

&gt; As George Santayana famously said in Reason of Common Sense (1905), “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Today, it is almost impossible to keep up with the range of food companies sponsoring research—from makers of the most highly processed foods, drinks, and supplements to producers of dairy foods, meats, fruits, and nuts—typically yielding results favorable to the sponsor’s interests.1 Food company sponsorship, whether or not intentionally manipulative, undermines public trust in nutrition science, contributes to public confusion about what to eat, and compromises Dietary Guidelines in ways that are not in the best interest of public health.

&gt; Kearns et al3 urge policymakers to view industry-funded studies with some skepticism. This is excellent advice. Disclosure of funding sources helps but is not sufficient to address the potential conflicts that can occur with such funding. These authors3 have done the nutrition science community a great public service by bringing this historical example to light. May it serve as a warning not only to policymakers, but also to researchers, clinicians, peer reviewers, journal editors, and journalists of the need to consider the harm to scientific credibility and public health when dealing with studies funded by food companies with vested interests in the results—and to find better ways to fund such studies and to prevent, disclose, and manage potentially conflicted interests.",2016-09-12,

Ok, to the extent that diet is a factor, lets consider Hong Kong diet.

In no particular order.
Cantonese are more rice focused than average Chinese.  Canton/Vietnam is around where rice waa originally domesticated and it shows.  Every meal has A pot of white boiled rice available.

Hong Kong is very Haute about variety of meats.  A typical family breakfast or dinner has as many dishes as people at table.   2 legs, 4 legs, no legs.  It means a meal has a bird (2 legs) dish, a pork/beef dish and a fish dish.   

No dairy, but plenty of broth.  Weird and wonderful mixtures that mums force their kida to drink.  It called tong. 

Fresh green vegies, historically china could be in famine, and canton would still be lush with food, its an extraordinary fertile region.  Lots of fresh chinese greens.  Again there is a profound focus on fresh.

Everything is cooked,  unlike the Vietnamese, Cantonese consider salad to be stir fry ingredients.  Raw food is considered risky (unclean).  (Unless it a thick skin fruit like a mandarin etc).  They dont do raw juice.

They live fast, cook fast, but eat slow.  Food is meant to be tasted, savoured.

dairy AND fertilizer,7tk9uz,Can butter be bad for male health?,nutrition,20,0.64,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/512140
One of the biggest arguments that are pro-dairy intake is that the hormones in dairy aren't enough to make an impact on human. However those studies have taken the average of both women en men, if you look at average male estrogen level in blood and look at the amount of different estrogens and progesterones(which both have been proven in clinical trials to lower testosterone production in males because of the negative feedback) in milk, butter and eggs and potentially in pregnant cow meat, obese animal meat you'll see that the dose is more than enough to double amount of estrogen at a certain time.
Note the concentration of 12ng/mL of progesterone in this cow milk. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524299/table/T1/
How about here in butter : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524299/table/T2/

Quote from the study : ""They found a maximum concentration of total estrone (sum of free and conjugated forms) in butter with 1.47 ng/g, which followed by 0.26, 0.17, 0.16, and 0.13 ng/g (or ng/ml) in cream, Gouda cheese, yoghurt, and milk, respectively"" 
Almost 90% of all available milk on the market is made from pregnant cows. Male average estrogen level is 15-60 pg/mL. http://www.hemingways.org/GIDinfo/hrt_ref.htm

It would mean that a 100g of butter could at a moment completely replace your production of estrogen, theoretically it could tank your male-hormone testosterone to production below 1%, but since your body becomes less sensitive to it it's probably less than that. This isn't including the other estrogen and the unbelievable amount of progesterone as well. The biological half-life(clearance) of estrogen in the body is 16-36 hours, probably slower for men. It would mean that eating dairy everyday in excess amounts would accumulate estrogen daily. Anyway my point is this could a bad consequence on male health, because testosterone can't directly regulate HPA-axis, it uses estrogen, that's why anabolic steroids shrink testiscle and if given an estrogen receptor blocker they wouldn't to the same extent. Since testosterone regulates muscle mass, it might have a secondary effect on fat-mass and create even more estrogen and even less testosterone through aromatase activity.
I couldn't find any source on daily male estrogen production, so I can't exactly pinpoint the extend of the effect, but since fertility doctors recommend to eat less dairy, it might be pretty bad. Average testosterone has already fell, even when adjusted to body-fat, having bad effects on fertility and health.
